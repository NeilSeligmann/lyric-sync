    summary: "How do you know that former blink-182 leader Tom DeLonge intends for his post-blink project Angels and Airwaves to be taken seriously? Because throughout their debut album, We Don't Need to Whisper, he relies on sounds and textures borrowed from 1988, the era when college rock was filled with atmospheric sonics and earnest politics. Specifically, he layers delayed guitars ripped from U2 over soundscapes equally inspired by the Cure, New Order, Peter Gabriel, and The Unforgettable Fire, all in an attempt to fashion a modern-day protest record. Lord knows it's an admirable break from his juvenile past, but good intentions don't necessarily make for good music, as We Don't Need to Whisper makes abundantly clear. DeLonge's main problem is that by relying on '80s college rock as his template, he's fallen into a lot of traps that have made albums of that era sound hopelessly dated: overlong intros, lasting upward of 90 seconds; formless songs that never seem to peak, only drift; cold keyboards that work a factory preset too heavily; an over-reliance on delay pedals, not just on the guitars (which never once sound like anybody other than the Edge), but on the keyboards, which has the unfortunate side effect of making the somber \"Distraction\" sound like an homage to Paul McCartney's gleefully moronic \"Wonderful Christmas Time.\" That's not the only unintentional chuckle here -- DeLonge's thin, nasal voice cuts against the moody murk of his band, as if he were a little kid recording over his big brother's music. It also doesn't help that his screeds about war, society, and life are overly written, with words piling on top of each other in free-form song structures that tend to collapse under the weight of his ambition. Since DeLonge was starting to edge toward an interesting fusion of dark post-punk, tuneful pop-punk, and mature concerns on the last blink-182 album, such an over-reach is a disappointment, but it is understandable; it's a classic case of post-breakup indulgence. It may not make for a successful record, but it does make for an interesting one, particularly in how DeLonge's desire to be taken seriously has led him to use the serious music of his adolescence as a signifier that he's serious now, but We Don't Need to Whisper is too doggedly dour and amorphous to be more than a curiosity. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "Relentless Mutation is the third studio album from Vancouver, British Columbia-based technical death metal band Archspire. It is the first release by the band since 2014's \"The Lucid Collective\", and the first release to feature bassist Jared Smith who replaced bassist and vocalist Jaron Evil who departed in 2014. Lead single \"Involuntary Doppelgänger\" was released on July 8th, 2017, followed by \"Remote Tumour Seeker\" on July 28th, \"Human Murmuration\" on August 25th, and \"Calamus Will Animate\" on September 15th. The full album was released one week later on September 22nd, 2017. The album caused the band to skyrocket in popularity. Relatively unknown before this release, they quickly became one of the leading bands in modern death metal, now with more streams than technical death metal legends like Necrophagist, Obscura, and Spawn of Possession.

    summary: "Cross Purposes could have been the ultimate Black Sabbath album. That may be a bold claim, but it combines members from several different eras together for perhaps the most promising lineup since Ronnie James Dio's days with the band. Geezer Butler is there to represent the classic '70s version, Tony Martin returned to the fold to be the '80s representative, new drummer Bob Rondinelli brings the '90s flavor to everything, and Tony Iommi is the never-say-die (no pun intended) original member who never left the flock. But instead of crafting Sabbath's masterful return to grace, they made a weird mishmash of power metal and stoner rock that works more often than not. At least Butler seems to have Iommi attempting memorable riffs again, something he couldn't quite get the hang of until the album previous to this. \"I Witness\" opens with a classic guitar part, while the drums drive the song along and the bass chugs away with a newfound energy. But this energy is offset by the increasingly soulful vocals of Martin, who simply cannot muster the creepy wail that Ozzy Osbourne brought to the band. In fact, he puts in a performance that is even below the standards he set on albums like The Eternal Idol. The minute his voice starts on the first track, it's as if Sabbath had to adjust to not make him sound out of place. Why the band couldn't have found a suitable replacement is a mystery, unless Iommi had simply given up on bringing in yet another singer after so many had come after Osbourne. \"Virtual Death\" is the brutally heavy shocker that suddenly appears in the middle of the album; it goes to show how they could have incorporated Martin much more effectively and is also the best slow crawl Iommi had worked on since 1983's \"Zero the Hero.\" Butler does seem to have a good influence on Iommi whenever they work together, and their interplay becomes quite interesting as the album goes on. For whatever reason, most of the filler is at the beginning, leaving the better material to hang back for the second half. \"Immaculate Deception\" contains another good riff, although keyboardist Geoff Nichols spews inappropriate new age nonsense all over it. \"Back to Eden\" improves matters again with more wonderful interaction between Butler and Iommi, while \"Cardinal Sin\" is yet another good song that goes to show how misused Martin had been during his first run with the band. Many might disagree, but Cross Purposes is the first album since Born Again that actually sounds like a real Sabbath record. And it is probably the best thing they'd released since The Mob Rules, even with the filler tracks and keyboards. Of course, the lineup completely dissolved as Iommi perpetuated the band's downward spiral, but for a brief moment it seemed like Sabbath could have really shaped up into something special. ~ Bradley Torreano",

    summary: "When the most influential heavy metal band ever to have roamed the earth teams up with Body Count's Ernie C to try and inject new life into their sound, it should have been the signal to give up the ghost. But poor Black Sabbath named an album Never Say Die because they meant it, and this sad album is a reminder of how dim even the brightest lights can get. Where their last album was an uneven but pleasant return to form, this is just the band going through the motions. \"Get a Grip\" takes its riff from Iommi's own \"Zero the Hero\" and totally wrecks it; \"Can't Get Close Enough\" is an awful power metal ballad; and \"Shaking Off the Chains\" might be the worst Tony Martin-fronted Sabbath song. And that is a bold claim considering how awful Tyr was. \"Illusion of Power\" is the weirdest song, with Martin dueting with Ice T on a song that sounds much more like Body Count than anything Sabbath-related. \"Sick and Tired\" is the only standout track; with its bluesy tempo and decent vocals, it sounds like Helloween performing a Cream song. But considering the vast legacy behind the band, it is truly a sad state of affairs when their best material sounds like a mid-level power metal band. It is hard to pinpoint the worst Sabbath album, but this could be it. With boring songs, awful production (from Ernie C), and uninspired performances, this is easily avoidable for all but the most enthusiastic fan. As a side note, the reception to this album was so poor that Iommi cleared out the lineup, gave in, and finally reconciled with Ozzy Osbourne for their spectacular reunion tour. ~ Bradley Torreano",

    summary: "By the late '80s everyone had pretty much given up on Black Sabbath...and why not? After all, guitarist Tony Iommi was the only remaining original member, and the band had seen an outrageous number of musicians -- particularly lead singers -- crash through its battered ranks since Ozzy Osbourne's late-'70s sacking. So it was actually quite a shock to anyone still paying attention when no-name vocalist Tony Martin outperformed a string of higher-profile predecessors with his contributions to Sabbath's unexpected 1987 return to form, The Eternal Idol, then pulled off the even more remarkable feat of being invited back for a second go-round via 1989's equally satisfying Headless Cross. Arguably the finest Black Sabbath album sans Ozzy or Dio, Headless Cross also featured one of Black Sabbath's most formidable lineups ever: matching the two Tonys with veteran bassist Neil Murray (Whitesnake, Gary Moore, etc.) and experienced journeyman Cozy Powell (too many associations to list) -- one of the few drummers in possession of an instantly recognizable sound. It's Powell, in fact, who leads the Sabs back out to the battlefield when he detonates the reverie of atmospheric intro \"The Gates of Hell\" with his echoing, pounding war drums, but naturally everything on offer is ultimately bound to, and dependent upon, Iommi's almighty riffs -- from whence all rivers flow. This includes morbid monster-pieces such as \"Kill in the Spirit World\" and \"Call of the Wild,\" which quake with simply massive power chords yet still manage to flow seamlessly into slightly more upbeat radio-friendly numbers like \"Devil and Daughter\" and \"Black Moon.\" Likewise, whereas \"When Death Calls\" is surely one of Iommi's most spine-chilling compositions ever in terms of sheer malevolent force, the equally bewitching \"Nightwing\" flips the coin entirely with its delicate acoustic guitars and (dare it be said) highly romantic lyrics. In short, for those wise enough to appreciate Black Sabbath's discography beyond the Osbourne and Dio essentials, there can be no better place to start than Headless Cross or its worthy predecessor, The Eternal Idol. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia",

    summary: "Gothic in approach, but crushing guitar riffs galore, Tyr followed Black Sabbath's previous return to the spotlight by less than a year. Again leaning heavily on the darker side of life, or perhaps, death, Tyr is a set of tunes loosely based around the Norse tales of Odin and the gods of war. \"Valhalla\" is unlike anything the old Sabbath tried, yet still sounds familiar. \"The Sabbath Stones\" mix myth with metal in a crushing display of musical synthesis. With Tyr, Black Sabbath sound as serious as can be. ~ James Chrispell",

    summary: "There comes a time in every punk's life where he or she has to grow up, or at least acknowledge that maturity is just around the corner. blink-182 put it off for as long as they could, but ten years into their career and two albums after their big breakthrough, 1999's Enema of the State, they decided to make a stab at being grown-ups for their eponymous sixth studio album. As with many self-titled albums, the trio uses this as an attempt to redefine itself, and they have considerably expanded both their sonic template and lyrical outlook on blink-182. They're still rooted in punk-pop, but even songs that stretch no further than that sound are a little darker, a little restless, reflecting the overall mood of the record. In shorthand, this is the record where blink-182 delve into post-punk, opting for some appealingly sullen moodiness, off-kilter hooks, lots of sonic textures, and even a duet with the Cure's Robert Smith. Since the trio is an inherently catchy group, this is a far cry from neo-post-punk groups like Interpol or even the dynamically hooky Hot Hot Heat, but there is a greater variety of sounds on blink-182 than on any of the trio's other albums, and the songwriting is similarly adventurous, alternating punchy, impassioned punk-pop with weirder, atmospheric pieces like \"Down\" and \"I'm Lost Without You.\" If nothing on the album has the immediate impact of \"All the Small Things\" -- though the opener, \"Feeling This,\" comes close -- and if, on the whole, blink-182 isn't as bracing or visceral as Dude Ranch or Enema, so be it: there's more to explore on this album than any of their other records. It's an unexpected and welcome maturation from a band that just an album ago seemed permanently stuck in juvenilia. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "First rule of greatest-hits albums: start things off with a bang, not a song that takes about a minute to get off the ground, and about 80 seconds before the vocals kick in. \"Carousel\" may be a chronologically accurate way to begin blink-182's Greatest Hits, yet it gets things off to a slow start -- but then again, blink-182 hardly sped out of the gate themselves. It took them a long time to get up to speed -- it wasn't until their third album, 1997's Dude Ranch, that they developed a flair for sugary pop hooks, as evidenced by that album's \"Dammit,\" not just their first big hit, but their first memorable song. It was enough to buy them a ticket to the big leagues and their next album, 1999's Enema of the State, turned into a blockbuster, thanks to the crossover Top Ten hit \"All the Small Things,\" an incessantly catchy, irresistible slice of bubblegum-pop that sounded at ease sandwiched between *NSYNC and Britney Spears on Y2K radio. This, as Greatest Hits proves, was both blink-182's blessing and curse: they had the ability to turn out some great pop singles, but when they missed the mark, they sounded lightweight and disposable. This wasn't just true of their defiantly stupid party songs, of which there were many; even such brooding, angst-ridden teenage melodramas as \"Adam's Song\" seem a little lightweight and transient. Of course, the band was helped neither by its crystal-clear, super-slick production -- which was the antithesis of punk -- or by the thin, whiny edge of vocalists Mark Hoppus and Tom Delonge -- which tended to make even serious themes seem like frivolous adolescent concerns. Over the long run, these two factors tend to undercut whatever snotty charms blink-182 may have had, particularly because their writing tended to be hit or miss, to the extent that even this Greatest Hits is uneven. It may have all their best songs -- \"Dammit\" and \"All the Small Things\" in particular, plus \"Josie,\" \"What's My Age Again?,\" \"The Rock Show,\" and \"Stay Together for the Kids\" -- but at 17 songs, including the previously unreleased \"Not Now\" and a cover of the Only Ones' \"Another Girl Another Planet\" taken from the MTV reality series starring drummer Travis Barker and his Playmate wife, this runs a little long. It may have all their charting singles, but its generous length tends to highlight blink-182's weaknesses instead of their strengths. That said, the group did set the standard for pop-punk's commercialization at the turn of the millennium, and not only were they better than the sound-alikes that followed, they did have some good tunes, all of which are best heard on this intermittently entertaining collection. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "Power punk funny guys blink-182 capture their witty stage presence on the limited-edition release The Mark, Tom and Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back). Celebrating the quick success of their major-label debut, 1999's Enema of the State, The Mark, Tom and Travis Show showcases playful live cuts and previously unreleased tracks and, in keeping with blink-182's punk revivalism, the album is only available from the time of release and January 2001. The Mark, Tom and Travis Show is indeed a real rock show and catches blink-182's shameless personalities and childlike giggling about oral sex, dog semen, and masturbation. But that's what makes blink-182 popular: the band's ability to not care about anything is a carefree look for the pop kids buying its records. The bandmembers' immaturity is harmless and fans love it. The quick guitar riffs and swirling percussion are intact, and guitarist Tom DeLonge's hyperactive retaliations against the audience are merely an act for the sake of being cool. DeLonge and bassist Mark Hoppus are even funnier with their on-stage brotherly love affair. It's high-speed energy at it's finest, probably the cheekiest punk rock stake since Green Day's \"Longview.\" And in the midst of teen pop mediocrity and post-grunge rollickers, it's good to see a band such as blink-182 enjoying its time on top of the world. ~ MacKenzie Wilson",

    summary: "So here it is, Neighborhoods, the inevitable reunion album, delivered eight years after blink-182’s last album, six years after Tom DeLonge indulged his U2 worship via Angels & Airwaves, five years after Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker whiled away their time with +44, and two years after the trio re-formed for a tour, igniting the long fuse that led to this sixth blink-182 album. Produced by the three blinkers themselves, Neighborhoods certainly is a different beast than any of the cheerfully snotty early blink-182 albums, as the band picks up the gloomy thread left hanging on its eponymous 2003 album, the one that was connected ever so slightly to “Stay Together for the Kids,” the hit from 2001’s Take Off Your Pants and Jacket that signaled some deeper emotions behind the goofy façade. Very little of that slapstick is retained on Neighborhoods; it’s been replaced by atmospheric echoes stripped from Angels & Airwaves, a pretension from DeLonge that’s given form and a pulse by Barker and Hoppus. Although there’s considerably more momentum -- and hooks! -- on Neighborhoods than either A&A album, this still gets plenty ponderous, taking so many scenic detours that the three-minute songs often seem twice as long. Blink-182 are hardly the first band to equate maturity with prog rock, going so far to cop a good chunk of their themes and artistic aesthetic for Neighborhoods from Rush’s “Subdivisions,” yet it’s far better to hear blink-182 grapple with adolescent angst via the perspective of middle age than vainly attempting to re-create their youth. Perhaps blink could stand to sharpen their words but it’s better that they concentrated on their music, creating a fairly ridiculous yet mildly compelling prog-punk spin on the suburbs here. Guess the hiatus did them some good. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "Few bands captured the Zeitgeist like blink-182 did during their time as the irreverent kings of Warped Tour-era pop punk in the late '90s and early 2000s. Like a nasally, SoCal, three-headed hydra, the band, featuring singer/guitarist Tom DeLonge, singer/bassist Mark Hoppus, and drummer Travis Barker, broke boundaries, gatecrashing MTV's TRL with their snotty, tongue-in-cheek music videos and anthems about falling in love at rock shows, making prank calls, and generally being stupid and having fun. Of course, there were darker times ahead, with DeLonge quitting the band and then returning and quitting again. Barker survived a 2008 plane crash that left him with multiple injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder. Finally, in 2021, Hoppus successfully underwent chemotherapy to treat a rare form of lymphoma, a diagnosis that ultimately brought the trio back together, looking to heal old wounds and rekindle lost friendships.\r\nIt's that feeling of gripping onto the past right before it slips away that the reunited blink-182 capture on their ninth studio album (or tenth, depending on if you count their initial demo), 2023's One More Time.... Produced by Barker, the album is their first to feature DeLonge since 2011's Neighborhoods. While the albums the group made with Alkaline Trio's Matt Skiba (2016's California and 2019's Nine) were solidly crafted, they always felt like something was missing. That something was DeLonge's goofy sincerity and hyper-resonant croon, two key elements of the group's classic sound, along with their crisp guitar, bass, and drum riffs that are front and center throughout all of One More Time.... Cuts like \"Dance with Me,\" \"Bad News,\" and \"Fell in Love\" are classic blink-anthems that wouldn't sound out of place on Enema of the State or Take Off Your Pants and Jacket. Yet, there are wounds here, and the band dig deep into them, working through the mess of bad breakup on \"More Than You Know\" and revealing the stark truth about taking someone's presence in your life for granted on \"You Don't Know What You've Got,\" the latter of which finds their voices intertwined in a throaty harmony. There's certainly the sense that blink-182 are working through the pain of the past two decades on One More Time..., including the death of close friends, divorces, and their own interpersonal drama. It's a vibe of carpe diem that they explicitly underline on the title track, singing \"I know that next time ain't always gonna happen/I gotta say, 'I love you' while we're here.\" One More Time... plays like a love letter, both to fans who stuck with them and to each other -- a letter that doesn't so much ask for forgiveness as offer it willingly, passionately, and without conditions. ~ Matt Collar",

    summary: "Not too much has changed since we last left blink-182. You might hear the same snap, crackle, and pop that the trio has prided themselves on for almost ten years. There's even the continual cabbage-patch screech of Tom Delonge and support for rampant teen angst. But five albums later, these San Diego natives grab their rosy-cheek punkadelics and add a bit more of a flamboyant, passionate maturation on Take Off Your Pants and Jacket. When Enema of the State leaped onto the charts in 1999, the lyrical direction was 90 percent party-boy mentality, leaving little room for traces of a growth spurt. And while we're still feeling the continual back-drip of tracks from Enema, the fresh plethora of tunes from these rambunctious Toys-R-Us rockers have more purpose than ever. With a fight-for-your-right joviality that's often irresistible, songs like \"Anthem Part 2\" and \"Stay Together for the Kids\" house a indomitable school-kid voice where a surging vapor of knockout speed chords meet wrecking-ball percussion. The meanings are bucketed and spilled, with lines like \"If we're f*cked up/You're to blame\" (\"Anthem Part 2\"). And forget about escaping lyrics such as, \"I'll never talk to you again/Unless your dad 'ill suck me off,\" which stems from the hilarious, almost brilliant 42-second clash called \"Happy Holidays, You Bastard.\" \"First Date\" and \"Roller Coaster\" are only a couple of their tunes that act as therapy for post-pubescent dilemma, also present on previous efforts like Enema and Dude Ranch. Each song about the rotten girlfriend or unhip parent speaks loud and often to the 2000 MTV generation. Nevertheless, the dumped-in-the-amusement-park tone and lyrical progression are sharp, if not entertaining. The band's stint on the Vans Warped Tour, with veteran punksters such as Pennywise and Rancid, has become a supreme outlet for blink-182. Take Off Your Pants is one of their finest works to date, with almost every track sporting a commanding articulation and new-school punk sounds. They've definitely put a big-time notch in the win column. ~ Darren Ratner",

    summary: "If anyone ever got the feeling that, in spite of its success, blink-182 has strayed much farther from its roots than the band ever expected possible (and possibly ever wanted), one listen to the eponymous disc from the side project of members Travis Barker and Thomas DeLonge would provide even more evidence. Box Car Racer removes the tongue-in-butt-cheek juvenility of the multi-platinum pop stars, and what remains could fit in perfectly alongside any of the emo output on indie labels such as Jade Tree. While blink-182 is known for providing poppy punk, this is as different as Bad Religion is to the band, just in the opposite direction, but the main divergence is lyrics that are retrospective and thoughtful -- witness \"Watch the World,\" which could fit on a Dashboard Confessional record, with a libretto that boarders on poetry. This is a far cry from the party-boy ethos DeLonge is best known for, and he wears the emotional depth well, with songs that are just as hooky as from his bread-winning main squeeze. ~ Brian O'Neill",

    summary: "Adrenaline is an appropriate title for this, Deftones' debut album, as all ten tracks explode with repressed energy. Unlike many of their contemporaries, Deftones are very controlled even in the midst of chaos. The musical attack is precise and well organized without sounding mechanical or soulless. Simply put, this music is the product of a good old-fashioned band, with every element of the music fitting together nicely. One of the practical ways in which this expresses itself is the way that Deftones groove, a skill that most nu-metal bands have somehow managed to lose along the way. Throw Abe Cunningham's surprisingly sophisticated drumming into the mix, and you have a band that possesses a far greater degree of nuance than most others that work in the genre. If there is a weakness to Adrenaline, it is that there is a bit of sameness in Chino Moreno's whispered vocal melodies, which drags the record down a bit. On later albums, the band's progressive tendencies become more developed, but the more straight-ahead material on Adrenaline does not disappoint. A promising debut. ~ Daniel Gioffre",

    summary: "As far as punk bands with a ska edge go, Goldfinger writes and performs punchy, three-minute slices of adrenaline as well as anyone, with the notable exception of Rancid. Of course, the whole genre is haunted by the specter of the late, great Clash, who did it better than anyone else. On Stomping Ground, Goldfinger shows a little more versatility. The beginning of \"The End of the Day\" almost has a Kinks feel to it. \"Bro\" is Soundgarden-heavy. Goldfinger still hasn't matched their breakthrough \"Here in My Bedroom\" from their 1996 debut, but \"I'm Down,\" \"San Simeon,\" \"You Think It's a Joke,\" and a cover of Nena's \"99 Red Balloons\" (interesting choice) highlight a fine album that's the logical next step for a still-maturing band, an adjective that doesn't often apply to a band in this genre. ~ Mark Morgenstein",

    summary: "When Green Day's first album appeared, anyone predicting that fame, MTV, top-selling albums, and more would be on the horizon in the near future would have been happily patted on the head and then sent to the insane asylum. It helps to remember that Nirvana's breakthrough was still a year away, for one thing, and, for another, 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours isn't a truly great album in the first place. It's not bad, by any means, and quite arguably just about everything on it could be transposed with a slight aural tweak here and there to Dookie or Insomniac without anyone batting an eye. It's just little more than a fun punk-pop album with some entertaining metallic flash here and there, one of many such records that the late '80s and early '90s produced in the indie rock world. After a great start with \"At the Library,\" it's quickly clear that the rest of the record is going to continue in the same vein. What's fun is realizing how much the band already had to work with, pursuing obvious love of three-chord forebears like the Dickies and the Ramones to energetic if not revelatory ends. Billie Joe Armstrong's balance of disaffection and nervous, goofy passion is well in place, while he's already showing his effective, no-frills approach to chewy feedback melody. Songs like \"I Was There\" and \"Road to Acceptance,\" not to mention the implicitly weed-celebrating \"Green Day\" itself, are great calling cards for later breakouts on both levels. Mike Dirnt's no slouch himself, providing good backing vocals when needed for harmony, but oddly enough the most prominent performance throughout comes from original drummer John Kiftmeyer, who wouldn't last through to the next album. Call it a quirk of recording, but there it is. ~ Ned Raggett",

    summary: "It's a bit tempting to peg Green Day's sprawling, ambitious, brilliant seventh album, American Idiot, as their version of a Who album, the next logical step forward from the Kinks-inspired popcraft of their underrated 2000 effort, Warning, but things aren't quite that simple. American Idiot is an unapologetic, unabashed rock opera, a form that Pete Townshend pioneered with Tommy, but Green Day doesn't use that for a blueprint as much as they use the Who's mini-opera \"A Quick One, While He's Away,\" whose whirlwind succession of 90-second songs isn't only emulated on two song suites here, but provides the template for the larger 13-song cycle. But the Who are only one of many inspirations on this audacious, immensely entertaining album. The story of St. Jimmy has an arc similar to Hüsker Dü's landmark punk-opera Zen Arcade, while the music has grandiose flourishes straight out of both Queen and Rocky Horror Picture Show (the '50s pastiche \"Rock and Roll Girlfriend\" is punk rock Meat Loaf), all tied together with a nervy urgency and a political passion reminiscent of the Clash, or all the anti-Reagan American hardcore bands of the '80s. These are just the clearest touchstones for American Idiot, but reducing the album to its influences gives the inaccurate impression that this is no more than a patchwork quilt of familiar sounds, when it's an idiosyncratic, visionary work in its own right. First of all, part of Green Day's appeal is how they have personalized the sounds of the past, making time-honored guitar rock traditions seem fresh, even vital. With their first albums, they styled themselves after first-generation punk they were too young to hear firsthand, and as their career progressed, the group not only synthesized these influences into something distinctive, but chief songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong turned into a muscular, versatile songwriter in his own right.\r\nWarning illustrated their growing musical acumen quite impressively, but here, the music isn't only tougher, it's fluid and, better still, it fuels the anger, disillusionment, heartbreak, frustration, and scathing wit at the core of American Idiot. And one of the truly startling things about American Idiot is how the increased musicality of the band is matched by Armstrong's incisive, cutting lyrics, which effectively convey the paranoia and fear of living in American in days after 9/11, but also veer into moving, intimate small-scale character sketches. There's a lot to absorb here, and cynics might dismiss it after one listen as a bit of a mess when it's really a rich, multi-faceted work, one that is bracing upon the first spin and grows in stature and becomes more addictive with each repeated play. Like all great concept albums, American Idiot works on several different levels. It can be taken as a collection of great songs -- songs that are as visceral or as poignant as Green Day at their best, songs that resonate outside of the larger canvas of the story, as the fiery anti-Dubya title anthem proves -- but these songs have a different, more lasting impact when taken as a whole. While its breakneck, freewheeling musicality has many inspirations, there really aren't many records like American Idiot (bizarrely enough, the Fiery Furnaces' Blueberry Boat is one of the closest, at least on a sonic level, largely because both groups draw deeply from the kaleidoscopic \"A Quick One\"). In its musical muscle and sweeping, politically charged narrative, it's something of a masterpiece, and one of the few -- if not the only -- records of 2004 to convey what it feels like to live in the strange, bewildering America of the early 2000s. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "By 1994, grunge had introduced mainstream culture to a punk-informed sound that was cathartic and exciting, but not exactly fun. The floodgates of alternative rock opened by Nirvana exposed Middle America to bands following in the angsty, grim footsteps of the Melvins and the Wipers, bringing in an entirely new idea of what aggressive music could be, but focusing more on tormented emotions than melody. Enter Green Day, one of many energetic pop-punk bands that had been thriving in independent circles as grunge exploded above ground, with a sound built on no-frills song structures played at hyper-fast tempos, but sweetened with tight vocal harmonizing borrowed from the Jam and pop hooks with the same stunning simplicity as the Beatles. Green Day perfected this winning formula on their first two albums (released with indie cornerstone Lookout Records), and with Dookie, their third studio full-length and first for major-label Reprise Records, the only thing that really changed was the recording budget.\r\nDookie was an almost immediate commercial breakthrough, perhaps in part because mainstream audiences had largely never heard anything like it before. The album produced charting hits with \"Longview,\" a loungy ode to boredom and self-love, the neurotic punk rock cardio workout \"Basket Case,\" and most successfully \"When I Come Around,\" a slacker punk answer to the power ballad that cracked the Top Ten and remained ever-present on the radio waves throughout 1995. While these songs were highlights, the entirety of Dookie is just as strong. The way the tracks fly by nervously in barrages of buzzing guitars and half-sung, half-sneered vocals from Billie Joe Armstrong intentionally aims to obscure how precise their arrangements are. From the bright blasting of opening track \"Burnout\" to the happy-go-lucky harmonies of torture fantasy \"Pulling Teeth,\" Green Day delight in smart subversion throughout Dookie and refuse to take themselves too seriously at any point, even when crafting perfect pop songs.\r\nThe band's lightning-fast tunefulness and irreverent attitude were a welcome change from the dour wallowing of grunge, and even the songs here about heavier subjects are delivered with a smirking, adolescent flippancy. The masses were finally ready for just this kind of punk rock when Dookie arrived, and the album not only marked Green Day's turn from basement trio to global rock stars, but also ushered in a wider collective understanding of punk that would cascade into the next generations of young, loud, and snotty melody-makers like blink-182, then Fall Out Boy, then Paramore, and so on. It's a turning point for alternative rock that still feels as vibrant decades later, and captures Green Day in a liminal state between obscurity and an almost impossibly unlikely level of fame, unaware of what was to come and simply working with the same raw materials they always had to make their next record one they could be proud of. ~ Fred Thomas",

    summary: "Dookie gave Green Day success, but it was never really clear whether they wanted it in the first place. However, given the incessantly catchy songwriting of Billie Joe, the success made sense. Green Day were traditionalists without realizing it, learning all of their tricks through secondhand records and second-generation California punk bands. They didn't change their sound in the slightest after signing to a major label, which meant that they couldn't revert back to a harsher, earlier sound as a way to shed their audience for Dookie's follow-up, Insomniac. Instead, they kept their blueprint and made it a shade darker. Throughout Insomniac, there are vague references to the band's startling multi-platinum breakthrough, but the album is hardly a stark confessional on the level of Nirvana's In Utero. It's a collection of speedy, catchy songs in the spirit of the Buzzcocks, the Jam, the Clash, and the Undertones, but played with more minor chords and less melody and recorded with a bigger, hard rock-oriented production. While nothing on the album is as immediate as \"Basket Case\" or \"Longview,\" the band has gained a powerful sonic punch, which goes straight for the gut but sacrifices the raw edge they so desperately want to keep and makes the record slightly tame. Billie Joe hasn't lost much of his talent for simple, tuneful hooks, but after a series of songs that all sound pretty much the same, it becomes clear that he needs to push himself a little bit more if Green Day ever want to be something more than a good punk-pop band. As it is, they remain a good punk-pop band, and Insomniac is a good punk-pop record, but nothing more. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "Following the cool reception to Insomniac, Green Day retreated from the spotlight for a year to rest and spend time with their families. During that extended break, they decided to not worry about their supposedly lost street credibility and make an album according to their instincts, which meant more experimentation and less of their trademark punk-pop. Of course, speedy, catchy punk is at the core of the group's sound, so there are plenty of familiar moments on the resultant album, Nimrod, but there are also new details that make the record an invigorating, if occasionally frustrating, listen. Although punk-pop is Green Day's forte, they sound the most alive on Nimrod when they're breaking away from their formula, whether it's the shuffling \"Hitchin' a Ride,\" the bitchy, tongue-in-cheek humor of \"The Grouch,\" the surging surf instrumental \"Last Ride In,\" the punchy, horn-driven drag-queen saga \"King for a Day,\" or the acoustic, string-laced ballad \"Good Riddance.\" It's only when the trio confines itself to three chords that it sounds tired, but Billie Joe has such a gift for hooky, instantly memorable melodies that even these moments are enjoyable, if unremarkable. Still, Nimrod suffers from being simply too much -- although it clocks in at under 50 minutes, the 18 tracks whip by at such a breakneck speed that it leaves you somewhat dazed. With a little editing, Green Day's growth would have been put in sharper relief, and Nimrod would have been the triumphant leap forward it set out to be. As it stands, it's a muddled but intermittently exciting record that is full of promise. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "Shenanigans is the companion piece to 2001's International Superhits. Where that compilation collected Green Day's singles, this rounds up the B-sides and such ephemera as soundtrack compilations, gathering the best (plus the new \"Ha Ha You're Dead\") for a 14-track trek through the band's alternate history. Now, any serious rock listener knows that B-sides don't necessarily mean subpar material, and such '90s bands as Oasis and Suede have had B-sides every bit as good as the material that made the official albums, and their subsequent B-sides albums have been gems in their discographies. This is largely because both bands had prime periods where everything they did pretty much turned to gold. Green Day never quite had an equivalent prime period. After they made their mark with Dookie, they maintained a high level of quality, constantly expanding their vision and refining their craft with each album, but they never had a time where they burned so brightly they couldn't fit all the great songs onto the proper albums and had to spill 'em out over the B-sides. Green Day knew what their best songs were, and apart from \"J.A.R.,\" which they threw out to the Angus soundtrack, they kept 'em on the albums, and they turned out material for B-sides largely because they had to; that was the game in the '90s -- you had to make sure the multi-part singles in the U.K. had unique material, and if a soundtrack came calling, you had to ante up. So, the songs that comprise Shenanigans are an appealing mixed bag since they were, by and large, songs Green Day finished because they had to. Since they're an excellent, restless band, there's variety here -- bits of surf rock, classic British Invasion, classic British punk, and singalong pop -- nothing is less than enjoyable, and some of it is quite good. But it's never terrific, revelatory, or amazing, giving the dedicated fans songs they just can't live without (to reduce it to the Oasis/Suede terms, no \"Acquiesce,\" no \"My Insatiable One\"). It's fun, to be sure, especially for the fans who are the compilation's target audience, but everything here sounds like the classic definition of B-sides -- good and familiar, but not as good as what made the album. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "By 2000, Green Day had long been spurned as unhip by the fourth-generation punks they popularized, and they didn't seem likely to replicate the MOR success of the fluke smash \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life).\" Apparently, the success of that ballad freed the band from any classifications or stigmas, letting them feel like they could do anything they wanted on their fifth album, Warning. They responded by embracing their fondness for pop and making the best damn album they'd ever made. There's a sense of fearlessness on Warning, as if the band didn't care if the album wasn't punk enough, or whether it produced a cross-platform hit. There are no ballads here, actually, and while there are a number of punchy, infectious rockers, the tempo is never recklessly breakneck. Instead, the focus is squarely on the songs, with the instrumentation and arrangements serving their needs. It's easy to say that Green Day have matured with this album, since they've never produced a better, more tuneful set of songs, or tried so many studio tricks and clever arrangements. However, that has the wrong connotation, since \"mature\" would indicate that Warning is a studious, carefully assembled album that's easier to admire than to love. That's not the case at all. This is gleeful, unabashed fun, even when Billie Joe Armstrong is getting a little cranky in his lyrics. It's fun to hear Green Day adopt a Beatlesque harmonica on \"Hold On\" or try out Kinks-ian music hall on \"Misery,\" while still knocking out punk-pop gems and displaying melodic ingenuity and imaginative arrangements. Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying; it finds the band at a peak of songcraft and performance, doing it all without a trace of self-consciousness. It's the first great pure pop album of the new millennium. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "Keeping the torch lit for anthemic emo rock, Chicago's Knuckle Puck come with big Warped Tour energy on their effusive third album, 2020's aptly titled 20/20. Though the group started in 2010, Knuckle Puck's sound has always harked back to the dynamic, early-2000s punk-pop and dual-vocal emo-rock of bands like Fall Out Boy and Taking Back Sunday. Showcasing vocalists Joe Taylor and guitarist/singer Nick Casasanto, Knuckle Puck streamlined that sound, offering their own sophisticated, endlessly melodic interpretation. It's an aesthetic they further hone on 20/20, an album rife with an emotional immediacy that feels informed by, if not explicitly about, the divisive U.S. cultural moments of 2020. More palpable is the sense that the band are looking back on their youth, letting themselves savor the melancholy of times passed and then finding the strength to move forward with a positive mindset. On \"Into the Blue\" they sing, \"I wanna swan dive from twenty-thousand feet above it all/I wanna fall into the blue/Could you help me feel infinite?/Just let me hold onto this feeling.\" It's a vibe they return to throughout the album, as on \"Tune You Out,\" \"True North,\" and \"Sidechain,\" goosebump-inducing anthems full of lightning-crisp guitar riffs, kinetic drum patterns, and unapologetically nasal vocal harmonies. Elsewhere, they conjure yet more inspiring vibes, evoking Smashing Pumpkins' \"1979\" on their ebullient \"Earthquake,\" and pairing with Mayday Parade vocalist Derek Sanders for the shimmering \"Breathe.\" Although it arrives a decade into Knuckle Puck's career, 20/20 is full of enough freshly invigorated energy and creative inspiration that it feels both familiar and brand new. ~ Matt Collar",

    summary: "Released in the fall of 1999, when Korn were in danger of being overshadowed by such protégés as Limp Bizkit, Issues reaffirms the group's status as alt-metal leaders, illustrating that the true difference between Korn and their imitators is their mastery of sound. Korn are about nothing if not sound. Sure, Jonathan Davis doesn't merely toss off lyrics, but in the end, it doesn't matter since his voice and the various words that float to the surface simply enhance the mood. Similarly, the band doesn't really have any distinguished riffs or hooks -- everything each member contributes adds to the overall sound -- so, casual listeners can be forgiven if they think the songs sound the same, since not only do the tracks bleed into one other, the individual songs have no discernible high points. Each cut rises from the same dark sonic murk, occasionally surging forward with volume, power, and aggression. It's mood music -- songs don't matter, but the foreboding feeling and gloomy sounds do. To a certain extent, this has always been true of Korn albums, but it's particularly striking on Issues because they pull off a nifty trick of stripping their sound back to its bare essentials and expanding and rebuilding from that. They've decided to leave rap-metal to the likes of Limp Bizkit, since there is very little rapping or appropriation of hip-hop culture anywhere on Issues. By doing this, they have re-emphasized their skill as a band, and how they can find endless, often intriguing, variations on their core sound. Issues may not be the cathartic blast of anger their debut was, nor is it as adventurous as Follow the Leader, but it better showcases the sheer raw power of the band than either. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "With little publicity, radio play, or MTV exposure, Korn took their eponymous 1994 debut to platinum status. Like all unexpected successes, it's easier to understand its popularity in retrospect. Although they disdain the \"metal\" label, there's no question that Korn are among the vanguard of post-grunge alt-metal outfits. Borrowing from Jane's Addiction, Rage Against the Machine, Pantera, Helmet, Faith No More, Anthrax, Public Enemy, and N.W.A, Korn developed a testosterone-fueled, ultra-aggressive metal-rap hybrid. They're relentless, both in their musical attack and in lead singer Jonathan Davis' bleak, violent lyrics. Tales of abuse and alienation run rampant throughout the record. It's often disturbing and, to some ears, even offensive, but their music can have a cathartic effect that makes up for their vulgarity and questionable lapses in taste. It's a powerful sound and one that actually builds on the funk-metal innovations of the late '80s/early '90s instead of merely replicating them. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

Korn add enough elements of alternative rock song structure to make the music accessible to the masses, and their songwriting has continued to improve. Nevertheless, the band's main strength is their raging, visceral sound, which is far more memorable and effective than their songs. The riffs might not always catch hold, but the primal guitars and vocals always hit home. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "Hurtling out of Gainesville, FL, Less Than Jake's decidedly generic sound initially raised few eyebrows around the local punk scene. That all changed in 1993, when the year-old quartet heard British skacore heroes Snuff. Inspired, the band enlisted saxophonist Jessica Schaub and reinvented its sound. Now serving up a blistering mix of third-wave ska and melodic punk, the band swiftly excited attention from all quarters, and a multitude of indie labels. Pezcore, their debut album, duly arrived in 1995, and across 19 numbers LTJ illuminated just what all the fuss was about. They weren't the only high-energy band on the scene, nor the only group with a predilection for catchy tunes and anthemic choruses, nor even the only bunch to fold ska into their sound, but they were one of the few to combine all three talents in one exhilarating package. What really made LTJ stand out, however, was the way they combined ska and punk. At the time, most bands had their separate punk and ska numbers, while a few would dramatically shift genres in the center of a song. LTJ, though, oftentimes skittered between punk and ska, so closely were the styles interwoven in the arrangements. The jittery \"Blindsided\" is a case in point, as the rhythm section and guitarist hiccup from rock to reggae, and the brass sprays out overhead. Equally important, the band didn't save the horns just for its straight ska songs; flooding even seemingly straight-ahead punk rockers like \"My Very Own Flag,\" only a few of the harder speedcore numbers like \"Jen Doesn't Like Me Anymore\" and \"Black Coffee\" escape. \"Growing Up on a Couch,\" in contrast, illustrates just how brilliantly the band interjected sax into hardcore. And it was this that truly captured fans' imaginations. Pezcore was filled with many such brilliant moments and soon-to-be fan faves, with standouts including \"Jen,\" \"Johnny Quest Thinks We're Sellouts,\" \"Liquor Store,\" the incredibly tight \"Boomtown,\" and the list goes on and on. The legend started right here. ~ Jo-Ann Greene",

    summary: "Taking the hard rock inclinations of Generation Terrorists to an extreme, the Manic Street Preachers delivered a flawed but intriguing second album with Gold Against the Soul. Inspired by Guns N' Roses, the Manics decided to rework their working-class angst as heavy arena rock; they seize upon the latent politicism of Guns N' Roses' tortured white-trash metal, interpreting it as a call to arms. Since the Manics are more intellectual and revolutionary than the Gunners, Gold Against the Soul burns with inspired, if confused, rhetoric. The Manics, however, aren't quite as gifted with hooks at this stage -- their power derives from their self-belief, which they can't quite translate into songs. They are given a bigger, louder production on Gold Against the Soul, which makes the album a more visceral listen than Generation Terrorists, but the songs aren't as consistently compelling as those on the debut. \"From Despair to Where\" is a vibrant anthem, and \"Drug Drug Druggy,\" \"Roses in the Hospital,\" \"Yourself,\" and \"Sleepflower\" all have a similar energy, but the peaks don't arrive quite as frequently as before. Nevertheless, the rage is more articulate and the sound is stronger, making Gold Against the Soul a flawed but worthy step forward. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "The most immediately noticeable aspect of ...And Justice for All isn't Metallica's still-growing compositional sophistication or the apocalyptic lyrical portrait of a society in decay. It's the weird, bone-dry production. The guitars buzz thinly, the drums click more than pound, and Jason Newsted's bass is nearly inaudible. It's a shame that the cold, flat sound obscures some of the sonic details, because ...And Justice for All is Metallica's most complex, ambitious work; every song is an expanded suite, with only two of the nine tracks clocking in at under six minutes. It takes a while to sink in, but given time, ...And Justice for All reveals some of Metallica's best material. It also reveals the band's determination to pull out all the compositional stops, throwing in extra sections, odd-numbered time signatures, and dense webs of guitar arpeggios and harmonized leads. At times, it seems like they're doing it simply because they can; parts of the album lack direction and probably should have been trimmed for momentum's sake. Pacing-wise, the album again loosely follows the blueprint of Ride the Lightning, though not as closely as Master of Puppets. This time around, the fourth song -- once again a ballad with a thrashy chorus and outro -- gave the band one of the unlikeliest Top 40 singles in history; \"One\" was an instant metal classic, based on Dalton Trumbo's antiwar novel Johnny Got His Gun and climaxing with a pulverizing machine-gun imitation. As a whole, opinions on ...And Justice for All remain somewhat divided: some think it's a slightly flawed masterpiece and the pinnacle of Metallica's progressive years; others see it as bloated and overambitious. Either interpretation can be readily supported, but the band had clearly taken this direction as far as it could. The difficulty of reproducing these songs in concert eventually convinced Metallica that it was time for an overhaul. ~ Steve Huey",

    summary: "Delivered five years after their eponymous \"black\" album in 1991, Load captures Metallica settling into an uneasy period of maturation. Under the guidance of producer Bob Rock, Metallica have streamlined their sound, cutting away most of the twisting, unpredictable time signatures and the mind-numbingly fast riffs. What's left is polished -- and disappointingly straightforward -- heavy metal. Metallica's attempts at expanding their sonic palette have made them seem more conventional than they ever have before. They add in Southern boogie rock, country-rock, and power ballads to their bag of tricks, which make them sound like '70s arena rock holdovers. Metallica's idea of opening up their sound is to concentrate on relentless midtempo boogie -- over half the album is dedicated to songs that are meant to groove, but they simply don't swing. Metallica sound tight, but with the material they've written, they should sound loose. That becomes apparent as the songs drag out over the album's nearly 80-minute running time -- there are only so many times that a band can work the same tempo exactly the same way before it becomes tedious. It isn't surprising to hear Metallica get stodgier and more conservative as they get older, but it is nonetheless depressing. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "Even though Master of Puppets didn't take as gigantic a leap forward as Ride the Lightning, it was the band's greatest achievement, hailed as a masterpiece by critics far outside heavy metal's core audience. It was also a substantial hit, reaching the Top 30 and selling three million copies despite absolutely nonexistent airplay. Instead of a radical reinvention, Master of Puppets is a refinement of past innovations. In fact, it's possible to compare Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets song for song and note striking similarities between corresponding track positions on each record (although Lightning's closing instrumental has been bumped up to next-to-last in Master's running order). That hint of conservatism is really the only conceivable flaw here. Though it isn't as startling as Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets feels more unified, both thematically and musically. Everything about it feels blown up to epic proportions (indeed, the songs are much longer on average), and the band feels more in control of its direction. You'd never know it by the lyrics, though -- in one way or another, nearly every song on Master of Puppets deals with the fear of powerlessness. Sometimes they're about hypocritical authority (military and religious leaders), sometimes primal, uncontrollable human urges (drugs, insanity, rage), and, in true H.P. Lovecraft fashion, sometimes monsters. Yet by bookending the album with two slices of thrash mayhem (\"Battery\" and \"Damage, Inc.\"), the band reigns triumphant through sheer force -- of sound, of will, of malice. The arrangements are thick and muscular, and the material varies enough in texture and tempo to hold interest through all its twists and turns. Some critics have called Master of Puppets the best heavy metal album ever recorded; if it isn't, it certainly comes close. [In 2017 the band released a massive expanded edition of the album with a variety of physical package options, the most ambitious of which was an exhaustive box set that included a hardcover book, outtakes and previously unreleased interviews, three LPs, ten CDs, a cassette, two DVDs, a lithograph, a folder with handwritten lyrics, and a set of six buttons.] ~ Steve Huey",

    summary: "After the muddled production and ultracomplicated song structures of ...And Justice for All, Metallica decided that they had taken the progressive elements of their music as far as they could and that a simplification and streamlining of their sound was in order. While the assessment made sense from a musical standpoint, it also presented an opportunity to commercialize their music, and Metallica accomplishes both goals. The best songs are more melodic and immediate, the crushing, stripped-down grooves of \"Enter Sandman,\" \"Sad but True,\" and \"Wherever I May Roam\" sticking to traditional structures and using the same main riffs throughout; the crisp, professional production by Bob Rock adds to their accessibility. \"The Unforgiven\" and \"Nothing Else Matters\" avoid the slash-and-burn guitar riffs that had always punctuated the band's ballads; the latter is a full-fledged love song complete with string section, which works much better than might be imagined. The song- and riff-writing slips here and there, a rare occurrence for Metallica, which some longtime fans interpreted as filler next to a batch of singles calculated for commercial success. The objections were often more to the idea that Metallica was doing anything explicitly commercial, but millions more disagreed. In fact, the band's popularity exploded so much that most of their back catalog found mainstream acceptance in its own right, while other progressively inclined speed metal bands copied the move toward simplification. In retrospect, Metallica is a good, but not quite great, album, one whose best moments deservedly captured the heavy metal crown, but whose approach also foreshadowed a creative decline. ~ Steve Huey",

    summary: "Metallica recorded so much material for Load -- their first album in five years -- that they had to leave many songs unfinished, otherwise they would have missed their deadline. During the supporting tour for Load, they continued to work on the unfinished material, as well as write new songs, and they soon had enough material for a new album, Reload. The title suggests that Reload simply is a retread of its predecessor, and in many ways that's correct -- there's still too much bone-headed, heavy Southern rock for it to be anything other than the sequel to Load -- but there's enough left curves to make it a better record. Marianne Faithfull's backing vocals on \"The Memory Remains\" complement the weird, uneasy melody, and \"Where the Wild Things Are\" has an eerie menace that Metallica never achieved on Load. There are also a couple of ballads and country-rockers that don't work quite so well (it's never a good idea to have an explicit sequel, as on \"The Unforgiven II\"), and that, along with a few plodding Metallica-by-numbers, is what keeps Reload from being a full success. Still, the towering closer, \"Fixxxer,\" along with handful of cuts that successfully push the outer edges of Metallica's sound, make the record worthwhile. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "Riding high on a wave of early success that allowed them to quit their day jobs and pursue their musical ambitions with renewed vigor, Welsh pop-punk combo Neck Deep delivered their highly optimistic sophomore set, Life's Not Out to Get You, in the summer of 2015. Although it proved to be a breakout release for the young band -- reaching the Top Ten in the U.K. and topping Billboard's Independent Albums chart in the U.S. -- the ensuing two years were fraught with personal tumult and cold doses of reality. While the anxiety of uncertain social and political climates has many artists asking big questions, also looming large among Neck Deep's inner woes is the death of frontman Ben Barlow's father. There are few events that cause a person to grow up faster than the untimely death of a parent, so it's no wonder the band returns a shade more sober on 2017's The Peace and the Panic. Overall more mature in content and tone, the band's third LP sees them expanding their boundaries somewhat while still adhering to a classic, if more muscular, pop-punk sound. Working with producer Neal Avron (Fall Out Boy, New Found Glory), Neck Deep find a nice balance between sprightly and serious, delivering the big riffy melodies they've become known for, over a more defined bed of parts. The bleak but tuneful \"Happy Judgment Day\" confronts the teetering knife's edge of contemporary politics, wondering if we've delivered ourselves to end times. The pleasingly introspective \"Parachute\" is a classic ode to escape, while \"Wish You Were Here\" nostalgically reflects on Barlow's father. If The Peace and the Panic is a darker affair than their first two records, it's not quite as dour as it sounds. While they've continued to progress as a band, Neck Deep are pop-punks to the core and this rousing set packs plenty of punch. ~ Timothy Monger",

    summary: "The Downward Spiral positioned Trent Reznor as industrial's own Phil Spector, painting detailed, layered soundscapes from a wide tonal palette. Not only did he fully integrated the crashing metal guitars of Broken, but several newfound elements -- expanded song structures, odd time signatures, shifting arrangements filled with novel sounds, tremendous textural variety -- can be traced to the influence of progressive rock. So can the painstaking attention devoted to pacing and contrast -- The Downward Spiral is full of striking sonic juxtapositions and sudden about-faces in tone, which make for a fascinating listen. More important than craft in turning Reznor into a full-fledged rock star, however, was his brooding persona. Grunge had the mainstream salivating over melodramatic angst, which had always been Reznor's stock in trade. The left-field hit \"Closer\" made him a postmodern shaman for the '90s, obsessed with exposing the dark side he saw behind even the most innocuous façades. In fact, his theatrics on The Downward Spiral -- all the preening self-absorption and serpentine sexuality -- seemed directly descended from Jim Morrison. Yet Reznor's nihilism often seemed like a reaction against some repressively extreme standard of purity, so the depravity he wallowed in didn't necessarily seem that depraved. That's part of the reason why, in spite of its many virtues, The Downward Spiral falls just short of being the masterpiece it wants to be. For one thing, fascination with texture occasionally dissolves the hooky songwriting that fueled Pretty Hate Machine. But more than that, Reznor's unflinching bleakness was beginning to seem like a carefully calibrated posture; his increasing musical sophistication points up the lyrical holding pattern. Having said that, the album ends on an affecting emotional peak -- \"Hurt\" mingles drama and introspection in a way Reznor had never quite managed before. It's evidence of depth behind the charisma that deservedly made him a star. ~ Steve Huey",

    summary: "Virtually ignored upon its 1989 release, Pretty Hate Machine gradually became a word-of-mouth cult favorite; despite frequent critical bashings, its stature and historical importance only grew in hindsight. In addition to its stealthy rise to prominence, part of the album's legend was that budding auteur Trent Reznor took advantage of his low-level job at a Cleveland studio to begin recording it. Reznor had a background in synth-pop, and the vast majority of Pretty Hate Machine was electronic. Synths voiced all the main riffs, driven by pounding drum machines; distorted guitars were an important textural element, but not the primary focus. Pretty Hate Machine was something unique in industrial music -- certainly no one else was attempting the balladry of \"Something I Can Never Have,\" but the crucial difference was even simpler. Instead of numbing the listener with mechanical repetition, Pretty Hate Machine's bleak electronics were subordinate to catchy riffs and verse-chorus song structures, which was why it built such a rabid following with so little publicity. That innovation was the most important step in bringing industrial music to a wide audience, as proven by the frequency with which late-'90s alternative metal bands copied NIN's interwoven guitar/synth textures. It was a new soundtrack for adolescent angst -- noisily aggressive and coldly detached, tied together by a dominant personality. Reznor's tortured confusion and self-obsession gave industrial music a human voice, a point of connection. His lyrics were filled with betrayal, whether by lovers, society, or God; it was essentially the sound of childhood illusions shattering, and Reznor was not taking it lying down. Plus, the absolute dichotomies in his world -- there was either purity and perfection, or depravity and worthlessness -- made for smashing melodrama. Perhaps the greatest achievement of Pretty Hate Machine was that it brought emotional extravagance to a genre whose main theme had nearly always been dehumanization. ~ Steve Huey",

    summary: "After Operation Ivy called it quits at the end of the '80s, Lookout put together this compilation of all of the recorded studio material ever released by the group. Much like Minor Threat's Complete Discography, this follows the recorded history of a band that burnt out quickly and had a relentlessly creative view of punk music. The underground classics are all here: \"Take Warning,\" \"Unity,\" \"Freeze Up,\" \"Junkie's Runnin' Dry,\" and 23 other prime tracks. Being one of the first bands to pursue the ska punk sound in California, Operation Ivy was a trailblazer in a genre that quickly became generic due to a glut of like-minded artists. But this should not be held against the group because they made fantastic music for the short time they existed. The CD comes complete with the lyrics to all of the songs, and several good pictures of the band. Countless bands would ape this sound without any creative improvement throughout the '90s, and two of the members would go on to lead the more punk-influenced Rancid. This might be the best ska punk collection by a single band committed to disc, and anyone with even a passing interest in the genre should do themselves a favor and buy this album right away. ~ Bradley Torreano",

    summary: "It was only a matter of time before someone added obvious hooks and electronic smarts to the post-industrial roar of alt-metal. That's exactly what Orgy does on its debut album, Candyass. It's hard to call this stuff industrial, since its sensibilities are directly out of metal -- hard-hitting riffs, big hooks, and tight songwriting -- but since Orgy is living in the electronica age, everything is given a computerized surface, complete with processed guitars and thundering digital bits. It's a now sound, no two ways about -- it's of the moment, totally 1998, and that's why it's hard to actually judge its merits. Candyass has the intoxicating rush of a new sound, but it's hard not to feel like all of its pleasures are on the surface. Still, you take pleasures where you can get them, and Orgy offers more than expected on this promising debut. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "On their third album, Songs for the Deaf, Queens of the Stone Age are so concerned with pleasing themselves with what they play that they don't give a damn for the audience. This extends to the production, with the entire album framed as a broadcast from a left-of-the-dial AM radio station, the sonics compressed so every instrument is flattened. It’s a joke run wild, punctuated by an ironic mock DJ, and it fits an album where the players run wild. As usual, Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri have brought in a number of guests, including Mark Lanegan on vocals and Dean Ween on guitar, but they’ve anchored themselves with the drumming of the mighty Dave Grohl, who helps give the band the muscle sorely missing from most guitar rock these days, whether it's indie rock or insipid alt-metal. QOTSA may be a muso band -- a band for musicians and those who have listened to too much music; why else did the greatest drummer and greatest guitarist in '90s alt-rock (Grohl and Ween, respectively) anxiously join this ever-shifting collective? -- but that’s the pleasure of the band, and Songs for the Deaf in particular: it’s restless and pummeling in its imagination and power. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "Probably the first album to successfully merge the seemingly disparate sounds of rap and heavy metal, Rage Against the Machine's self-titled debut was groundbreaking enough when released in 1992, but many would argue that it has yet to be surpassed in terms of influence and sheer brilliance -- though countless bands have certainly tried. This is probably because the uniquely combustible creative relationship between guitar wizard Tom Morello and literate rebel vocalist Zack de la Rocha could only burn this bright, this once. While the former's roots in '80s heavy metal shredding gave rise to an inimitable array of six-string acrobatics and rhythmic special effects (few of which anyone else has managed to replicate), the latter delivered meaningful rhymes with an emotionally charged conviction that suburban white boys of the ensuing nu-metal generation could never hope to touch. As a result, syncopated slabs of hard rock insurrection like \"Bombtrack,\" \"Take the Power Back,\" and \"Know Your Enemy\" were as instantly unforgettable as they were astonishing. Yet even they paled in comparison to veritable clinics in the art of slowly mounting tension such as \"Settle for Nothing,\" \"Bullet in the Head,\" and the particularly venomous \"Wake Up\" (where Morello revises Led Zeppelin's \"Kashmir\" riff for his own needs) -- all of which finally exploded with awesome power and fury. And even listeners who were unable (or unwilling) to fully process the band's unique clash of muscle and intellect were catered to, as RATM were able to convey their messages through stubborn repetition via the fundamental challenge of \"Freedom\" and their signature track, \"Killing in the Name,\" which would become a rallying cry of disenfranchisement, thanks to its relentlessly rebellious mantra of \"Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me!\" Ultimately, if there's any disappointment to be had with this near-perfect album, it's that it still towers above subsequent efforts as the unequivocal climax of Rage Against the Machine's vision. As such, it remains absolutely essential. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia",

    summary: "With the three-chord assault of \"Blitzkrieg Bop,\" The Ramones begins at a blinding speed and never once over the course of its 14 songs does it let up. The Ramones is all about speed, hooks, stupidity, and simplicity. The songs are imaginative reductions of early rock & roll, girl group pop, and surf rock. Not only is the music boiled down to its essentials, but the Ramones offer a twisted, comical take on pop culture with their lyrics, whether it's the horror schlock of \"I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement,\" the gleeful violence of \"Beat on the Brat,\" or the maniacal stupidity of \"Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue.\" And the cover of Chris Montez's \"Let's Dance\" isn't a throwaway -- with its single-minded beat and lyrics, it encapsulates everything the group loves about pre-Beatles rock & roll. They don't alter the structure, or the intent, of the song, they simply make it louder and faster. And that's the key to all of the Ramones' music -- it's simple rock & roll, played simply, loud, and very, very fast. None of the songs clock in at any longer than two and half minutes, and most are considerably shorter. In comparison to some of the music the album inspired, The Ramones sounds a little tame -- it's a little too clean, and compared to their insanely fast live albums, it even sounds a little slow -- but there's no denying that it still sounds brilliantly fresh and intoxicatingly fun. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

Though not quite as commercially viable as the more straightforward Slipknot album, Iowa is a more interesting listen, one that envelopes you in its American Gothic shadow and leaves you feeling unsettled afterward.

    summary: "These nine Midwestern boys (all from Des Moines, IA) perform wearing orange industrial coveralls with UPC symbols on the front; each bandmember is identified by a number, which is painted on the sleeve of his coveralls. Each also wears a really nasty-looking mask. Judging from their appearance and from the sound of their debut album, it's easy to assume that they're upset about something. What it is exactly is kind of hard to tell, since the stuttering roar of Number 8's vocals is barely discernible through the jackhammer death metal drums, massed guitars, horror-show samples, and jittery turntable scratches that pummel the listener through almost every song. You thought Limp Bizkit was hard? They're the Osmonds. These guys are something else entirely. And it's pretty impressive. Although those lyrics that are discernible are not generally quotable on a family website, suffice it to say that the members of Slipknot are not impressed with their fathers, their hometown, or most anything else. \"Surfacing\" starts out by cursing pretty much everything generally, and then it starts getting aggressive, as shrieking guitar feedback alternates with DJ scratching. \"Spit It Out\" is speed rap-metal with an actual melody in the chorus; \"Scissors\" ends the program with a sound that quite simply couldn't get any more aggro without falling apart entirely, and by the end, the singer actually sounds like he's about to burst into tears. An auspicious debut. [Slipknot reissued their eponymous debut in 2009 to mark the record's 10th anniversary.

    summary: "Slipknot set out to construct the ultimate metal music flamethrower, ever since their genesis in a Des Moines, IA, basement. But they also deployed an agitprop campaign of masks, smocks, and bar codes that helped scare parents (like good metal should) and transform Slipknot fans into faithful \"maggots.\" The Midwestern origin of all this craziness is genius, as the band's marrow-draining metal and twisted, fibrous mythology is antithetical to the region's milquetoast rep. Still, after the gothic nausea of 2001's Iowa, Slipknot's vitality dissipated in clouds of gaseous hype and individual indulgence. Had they grown fat on their thrones? Probably. But the layoff only makes Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses scream louder. Working with famously bearded helmer Rick Rubin -- aka He Who Smites Bullsh*t -- Slipknot pour the shrill accessibility of their self-titled debut down Iowa's dark sieve, and the result is flinty, angry, and rewardingly restless. Vol. 3 shares its lyrical themes of anger, disaffection, and psychosis with most of Slipknot's nu-metal peers. Lines like \"I've screamed until my veins collapsed\" and \"Push my fingers into my eyes/It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache\" (from the otherwise strong \"Duality\") aren't unique to this cult. But unlike so many, the band's sound rarely disassembles into genre building blocks: riff + glowering vocal + throaty chorus = Ozfest acceptance. What makes Vol. 3 tick is the dedication to making it a Slipknot album, and not just another flashy alt-metal billboard. The seething anger and preoccupation with pain is valid because it's componential to the group's uniquely branded havoc. \"Blister Exists,\" \"Three Nil,\" and \"Opium of the People\" are all standouts, strafing soft underbellies with rhythmic (occasionally melodic) vocals, stuttering, quadruple-helix percussion, and muted grindcore guitar. Rubin is integral to the album's power -- his cataclysmic vocal filters and arrays of unidentifiable squiggle and squelch unite Vol. 3's various portions in wildly different ways. Just when the meditative \"Circles\" threatens to keel over from melodrama, in sputters strings of damaged electronics and percussion to lead it into \"Welcome,\" which sounds like Helmet covering Relapse Records' entire catalog at once. Later, another counterpoint is offered, when the swift boot kicks of \"Pulse of the Maggots\" and \"Before I Forget\" separate \"Vermilion\"'s gothic and acoustic parts. Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses doesn't feel like Slipknot's final statement. It's a satisfying, carefully crafted representation of their career to date. But there's a sense that whatever Slipknot do next might be their ultimate broadcast to the faithful. ~ Johnny Loftus",

    summary: "With their debut, 40oz. to Freedom, Sublime attempt to have it both ways. The group wants to appeal to alterna-punks, but they want to cut a little deeper and make some sort of social statement, both with their lyrics and their self-consciously eclectic music. Since the group has a knack for combining dancehall reggae with hardcore punk, the music can be nervy and invigorating, but their joyous blend of cultures doesn't fare so well at the lyrical level. No matter how you look at it, \"Date Rape\" isn't a bold, ironic satire on macho mores -- it's frat rock that's bound to be misinterpreted, especially with its homophobic \"I can't take pity on men of his kind, even though he now takes it in the behind\" conclusion. Lyrics like that prevent 40oz. to Freedom from being the cracking, skanking skatepunk record that it had the potential to be. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "Sublime's eponymous major-label debut arrived a few months after the band's leader, Brad Nowell, died tragically of a heroin overdose. As a show of sympathy, the album tended to be slightly overrated in some critical quarters, who claimed that Nowell was an exceptionally gifted lyricist and musical hybridist, but Sublime doesn't quite support those claims. Even so, the trio does have a surprising grace in its unabashedly traditionalist fusion of Californian hardcore punk, light hip-hop, and reggae. Switching between bracing hardcore and slow, sexy reggae numbers, Sublime display supple, muscular versatility and, on occasion, a gift for ingratiatingly catchy hooks, as on the hit single \"What I Got.\" What they don't have is the vision -- either lyrical or musical -- to maintain interest throughout the course of the entire album. Sublime sags when the band delves too deeply into their dub aspirations or when their lyrics slide into smirking humor. The low moments don't arrive that often -- by and large, the album is quite engaging -- but they happen frequently enough to make the record a demonstration of the band's blossoming ability, but not the fulfillment of their full potential. Of course, Nowell's death gives the record a certain pathos, but that doesn't make the album any stronger. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "Sum 41 album three, Does This Look Infected?, is much like Sum 41 album two, which was much like their lesser-known indie debut, Half Hour of Power. Which means, Does This Look Infected? sounds much like the work of Blink-182's snottier kid brothers, who are just in it for good times. Frankly, it's kind of a relief to be spared both the smutty double entendres and the self-pity, and while they still rely too much on processed guitar distortion and have sparkling productions, Sum 41 makes up for that cleanliness with vigorous performances and simple, catchy hooks. It's pretty fun, particularly since the whole affair is blissfully short at a few minutes over a half-hour, giving it a nice, punchy effect. There's nothing here that's unexpected, but it's delivered well, so it's a fun little record...but it's not much more than that, either. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "System of a Down's 1998 debut was initially overlooked by the mainstream hard rock audience, as well as the specialized press. But heavy metal cognoscenti in both camps quickly realized that in their hands was a potentially crucial stepping stone for the future development of heavy metal. Sure enough, so challenging and groundbreaking were its contents that the album soared over most everyone's unsuspecting heads, its eventual gold sales status only achieved via Columbia Records' massive promotional muscle and nearly three years of intensive touring on the band's part. Consequently, early believers were pleasantly surprised when 2001's long awaited follow-up, Toxicity met with instant popular acceptance, skyrocketing up the charts toward multi-platinum success. Yet, for the most part, it also managed to retained SOAD's unorthodox signature sound: so-called \"nu-metal\" uniquely infused with remarkable originality, including angular riffs, jagged rhythms, and oblique lyrics splattered all over the place. Like its predecessor, Toxicity seems utterly chaotic upon first listen, but things quickly begin falling into place, thanks to a number of small refinements, not least of which is a more generous melody, obviously pre-meditated, but rarely overdone. In turn, this immediacy greatly improved the album's chances at radio -- case in point, first single \"Chop Suey!,\" a track so potent not even September 11, nor mainstream radio's ensuing self-imposed, politically correct attempt at self-censorship, could tear from the airwaves (despite its none-too-discreet lyrics about suicide), the song's surprising success was reminiscent of another left-field hit from a decade earlier, Faith No More's \"Epic\" (hear its piano-led outro for proof). And sure enough, from the unexpected false starts of \"Prison Song\" to the relatively mellow conclusion, the band's heightened commercial sensibility continues to joust with their inherently quirky songwriting. The excellent title track, \"Forest,\" and \"Science\" are among the most accessible standouts from an incredibly diverse set, the likes of which SOAD's inferior nu-metal peers could only hope to emulate. Lyrically, it's simply no contest. Whether tackling typical rock subject matter like drug abuse (\"Needles\") and groupies (\"Psycho\"), or embarking on inscrutable Dadaist gems like \"Jet Pilot\" and \"Shimmy,\" co-songwriters Daron Malakian and Serj Tankain sound like are the bastard children of Frank Zappa and Slayer. And while sub-Rage Against the Machine political invective (unfairly attributed to their Armenian heritage) remains an integral part of the band's creative makeup (e.g. \"Deer Dance,\" \"Atwa\"), Toxicity's approach is much more cautious in this regard than that of their incendiary debut. In conclusion, when a band takes this many left turns, you'd expect them to start going in circles sooner rather than later, but this is not the case with System of a Down. Hands down one of 2001's top metal releases, Toxicity may well prove to be a lasting heavy metal classic to boot. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia",

    summary: "In an age where major labels dictate that new releases from bands appear on record store shelves every 18 months or so, rare is the artist given freedom and ability to reflect and stretch out to explore creative evolution and release music as an artist, rather than the prepackaged predictability of an entertainer. Thankfully, Tool has somehow managed to circumvent these rituals, releasing a record every four to five years as they so feel the need. This ability to patiently craft their musical direction has paid off for not only the band, but for listeners, as they've been able to expand their musical vocabulary from album to album with great precision, all the while remaining true to the foundations that built such a loyal, if not cult-like, following. But with this absence comes changes to the popular music landscape, as new bands and sounds (as well as a new generation of heavy metal fans to entertain) replace and stimulate the charts. Namely: a lot can happen in five years, especially with a fickle rock audience that is overinundated with constant new bands' songs. The group defied expectations (and even got radio airplay) with Lateralus, but would fans stick with them during the hiatus? There were moments when Maynard James Keenan would emerge courtesy of A Perfect Circle, and there were also several stunning video DVDs to pacify while 10,000 Days was being written, along with cryptic messages via their website, but that was about it.\r\nThankfully, 10,000 Days was worth the labor pains and wait to deliver. It's not only a step forward for the band, but a re-embracing of the epic-length rock songs found at the roots of early heavy metal. The album starts out with \"Vicarious,\" which features some of Maynard's most straightforward lyrics since Ænema's \"Hooker with a Penis.\" Essentially a biting commentary on reality television, information stimulus overload, and living through others' experiences, it's only a brief glimpse of what's to come, as 10,000 Days also offers some of Keenan's most confessional lyrics. The 17-minute epic \"Wings for Marie/10,000 Days\" is an ode to his mother, who passed away during the band's hiatus after dealing with paralysis from a stroke for 27 years. In a way, it's voyeuristic to listen to someone working out family issues on disc, but Keenan does it in a way that's sensitive and honest without ever treading the careful line between melodrama and sincerity. Most of the songs are a bit long in the tooth when compared to most metal songs these days, but then again, Tool isn't exactly just another band, either. With most songs clocking in over six minutes, the exercises in songwriting wouldn't work as well with any other band. But when you have such high-caliber musicianship as Danny Carey and Adam Jones anchoring drums and guitar, respectively, it's hard to make a wrong turn. The anger that served as fuel for some of their greatest works has been replaced with calmer and more introspective moments as they patiently work out rhythm and melodic passages from one theme to the next. That's not to say the anger isn't still there; it does check in from song to song, but like most of Tool's fan base that has stuck with them through their first recordings, the group has evolved beyond that stage and has moved on to new concepts to explore. So depending upon which Tool you are looking for, you're either going to love or hate 10,000 Days. If it's the hard-driving band with an intellectually driven existential anger and fits of Hot Topic-laden angst, they've fled for other pastures (probably to Arizona Bay). But if you're looking for the Tool whose passion and introspection is complemented by intense emotion, brutal honesty, and musical maturity, you'll be hard-pressed to find a better metal album in 2006. ~ Rob Theakston",

    summary: "For their second release, Tool explore the progressive rock territory previously forged by such bands as King Crimson. However, Tool are conceptually innovative with every minute detail of their art, which sets them apart from most bands. Make no mistake, this isn't your father's rock record. Sonically, the band has never sounded tighter. Long exploratory passages are unleashed with amazing precision, detail, and clarity, which only complements the aggressive, abrasive shorter pieces on the album. There is no compromise from any member of the band, with each of them discovering the dynamics of his respective instrument and pushing the physical capabilities to the limit. Topics such as the philosophies of Bill Hicks (eloquently eulogized in the packaging), evolution and genetics, and false martyrdom will fly over the heads of casual listeners. But those listening closely will discover a special treat: a catalyst encouraging them to discover a world around them to which they otherwise might have been blind. If these aren't good enough reasons to listen to Ænima, then just trust the simple fact that Tool deliver the hard rock goods every time the band chooses to release something. ~ Rob Theakston",

    summary: "With almost 13 years and four months between releases -- an interminable wait for their devoted legion of fans -- enigmatic alt-metal band Tool finally returned at the end of summer 2019 with their long-awaited fifth album, Fear Inoculum. Clocking in at 80 minutes with just seven official tracks, this is less a straightforward rock record and more a mind-bending journey, borrowing a classical approach that trades traditional constructs heard on early radio staples like \"Stinkfist\" and \"Sober\" for something akin to movements within a symphony. Much like the directional shift that occurred around the time of 2001's Lateralus, Fear Inoculum expands on 10,000 Days' alternative, prog-metal jam band design while recapturing some of the excitement and freshness from their commercial peak during the Ænima/Lateralus years. Seamless arrangement and complex artistry set the album in typically ambitious territory for vocalist/lyricist Maynard James Keenan, guitarist Adam Jones, bassist Justin Chancellor, and percussion wizard Danny Carey, who are at the peak of their collective musicianship (Carey's instrumental drum showcase, \"Chocolate Chip Trip,\" is simply on another level). Not surprisingly, after over a decade, the foursome have matured, presenting an older, wiser perspective born of a well-adjusted shift into the hard-won comforts of adulthood. Complex metaphors about sodomy, allusions to alien abductions, and sophomoric inside jokes have been set aside, resulting in serious ruminations on aging and their legacy (\"Invincible\"), as well as a vested interest in humanity's future (\"Descending\"). They cast away negativity on the hypnotic title track, a trance-like prayer to immunize against evil and those ills that might drag us down. Instead of lusting for an apocalyptic purge à la the misanthropic \"Ænima,\" Keenan laments society's downhill trajectory on \"Descending,\" flipping his usual script with a late-song twist that pleads for us to save ourselves before it's too late. Shunning the fatalistic on album highlight \"Pneuma,\" he urges listeners to break free, liberate the titular spirit, and unite as one, while Jones, Chancellor, and Carey build the hulking track to a shiver-inducing close over the span of 12 minutes. While these track times are imposing (epic closer \"7empest\" is a whopping 15 minutes of elevated metal exploration), the thrill of the trip is so well executed and beautiful that constructs of time and space evaporate and help Fear Inoculum feel like a brisker listen than Lateralus or 10,000 Days. As with everything associated with Tool, fans will likely spend the next 13 years and four months dissecting the complex time signatures, layered lyrics, and the symbol-loaded album artwork, which are crucial aspects to the esoteric band's enduring appeal. Considering the long gap between albums, there was a lingering fear that they couldn't live up to their own hype or legacy. Fortunately, Tool managed to improve and perfect their sound even further, resulting in one of the strongest statements in their catalog. Whether 10,000 days or the actual 4,868, Fear Inoculum was well worth the wait. ~ Neil Z. Yeung",

    summary: "After an exhaustive five-year litigation battle between the band and their label management, Tool offer up the latest chapter in their musical self-discovery in Lateralus. Make no mistake, this is a prog rock record, reminiscent of King Crimson and Meddle-era Pink Floyd, with a hint of Rush mutated with Tool's signature sonic assault on the ears. Lateralus demands close listening from the first piece onward, as it becomes quickly apparent that this is not going to be an album one can listen to and accept at face value. Complex rhythm changes, haunting vocals, and an onslaught of changes in dynamics make this an album other so-called metal groups could learn from. While some compositions seem out of place, others fit together seamlessly, such as the 23-minute song cycle serving as the climax and resolution of the album. However, the album's most disturbing moment arrives at the end, with dissonant electronic noises placed randomly with a drum solo over a phone call to a talk show discussing the secrets behind Area 51, once again serving as a symbolic gesture from the band encouraging people not to take things at face value and to think for themselves. Overall, a solid, well-produced album from a band that never fails to deliver with each release. ~ Rob Theakston",

    summary: "Just as grunge was reaching its boiling point and radio-friendly punk-pop loomed on the horizon, Tool released Undertow, which firmly reinforced metal's prominence as a musical style -- but, for once, it had something worthwhile to say. At the forefront of Tool's commercial explosion were striking, haunting visuals that complemented the album's nihilistic yet wistful mood. Drawing equal inspiration from Black Sabbath, alternative theories of science, and Eastern religions, Tool's abrasive sonic assault begins from the opening notes and continues through the final moments of the last composition, an open mockery of organized religion and its incapacity for original thought. With its technical brilliance, musical complexities, and aggressive overtones, Undertow not only paved the way for several bands to break through to the mainstream adolescent mall-rage demographic, it also proved that metal could be simultaneously intelligent, emotional, and brutal. ~ Rob Theakston",

    summary: "Wall of Voodoo's Seven Days in Sammystown was the work of a radically different band than the one that gave the world \"Mexican Radio\" and its classic parent album Call of the West just a few years earlier. This was the first album by the post-Stan Ridgway lineup, and featured a new lead singer in Andy Prieboy, as well as a more conventional (but first-rate) drummer named Ned Leukhardt in place of drum-machines-and-pots-and-pans player Joe Nanini. Rounding out the new lineup were returning Call of the West-era members Marc Moreland (guitars) and Chas T. Gray (keyboards), along with Marc's brother Bruce Moreland (bass), who had played with the band in the early years. Unfortunately, by choosing to stick with the band name Wall of Voodoo, certain expectations were set up about how the record would sound -- Nanini and especially Ridgway were very distinctive performers -- and Seven Days in Sammystown often fails to deliver on these expectations. The album does get off to a memorable start with \"Far Side of Crazy,\" a disturbing examination of an unrepentant serial killer (and a song that rather surprisingly became a minor hit in Australia). But after that, it's an uneven ride, as the band either tries too hard to deliver Ridgway-esque pulp-fiction inspired narratives that end up sounding somewhat self-conscious (\"This Business of Love,\" \"Big City\"), or else Ian Broudie's production becomes a little too slick and ruins the intended dark mood. There are a few highlights, though, particularly Prieboy's frantic rant \"Room With a View\"; a reverent re-interpretation of the classic miners' lament \"Dark as a Dungeon\"; and the kitschy but touching \"(Don't Spill My) Courage,\" the story of a paraplegic who refuses to use his religious faith as a crutch. Also, for longtime Wall of Voodoo fans, underappreciated guitarist Marc Moreland is allowed to step to the fore on several cuts and show off his skill at both old-style Western picking and modern electronic dissonance and distortion. If Wall of Voodoo had decided to change their name and reinvent themselves as a \"new\" band, Seven Days in Sammystown might have been considered their promising, if flawed, debut. Sadly, however, the band decided to stick with the Wall of Voodoo brand name -- meaning that Seven Days in Sammystown wound up as merely a minor artifact in the Wall of Voodoo catalog. ~ Rudyard Kennedy",
