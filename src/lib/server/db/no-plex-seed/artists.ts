    summary: "In 2005, when pop-punk superstars blink-182 announced an indefinite hiatus, the band split into two side projects: +44 and Angels & Airwaves. The latter group, fronted by Tom DeLonge, went in a synth-friendly, arena rock direction, debuting in 2006 with We Don't Need to Whisper. By the late 2010s, DeLonge had officially parted ways with blink, and Angels & Airwaves was a full-fledged entity with half-a-dozen releases in their catalog including the two-part Love and 2014's The Dream Walker. After a short break, DeLonge resurrected the project in 2019, with their sixth album, Lifeforms, arriving in 2021.\r\nWith the hiatus of pop-punk superstars blink-182 in full effect by the fall of 2005, singer/guitarist DeLonge revealed the formation of his new band -- one he'd already been working with for six months -- called Angels & Airwaves. DeLonge proclaimed that his new music would borrow arena-sized elements from bands like U2 and Pink Floyd and, ultimately, be something of a revolution to change the face of rock & roll forever. Rounding out his lineup were guitarist David Kennedy (Boxcar Racer, Hazen Street), drummer Atom Willard (Rocket from the Crypt, the Offspring), and bassist Ryan Sinn (the Distillers), and the group made their live debut on April 12, 2006, to a sold-out crowd at Pomona, California's Glass House. Those unable to attend the show were given a taste of Angels & Airwaves' shimmering, arena-ready rock later that spring, when We Don't Need to Whisper was released on the Geffen label.\r\nThe album was met with mixed reviews but went gold nonetheless, due in large part to a popular presale that ensured the band a healthy first week of sales. Several U.K. festival appearances and a month-long headlining tour followed, and the group also served as an opening act for Head Automatica and Taking Back Sunday during a tour of American venues. After replacing Sinn with former 30 Seconds to Mars bassist Matt Wachter, Angels & Airwaves returned in 2007 with their second album, the equally dramatic I-Empire. Although deemed by DeLonge to be \"as exciting as rock 'n' roll gets!\" in an interview with Kerrang!, I-Empire didn't fare nearly as well as the previous album, with sales eventually stalling around 260,000 copies in America. A stateside tour in early 2008 proved to be fairly popular, though, and the group remained on the road by joining the Warped Tour later that year.\r\nAt the Grammy Awards on February 8, 2009, DeLonge climbed on-stage with Travis Barker and Mark Hoppus to announce plans for a blink-182 reunion. The band toured that summer and spent a significant amount of time in the recording studio, where sessions for a new blink-182 album kept DeLonge busy. He found enough free time to record a third album with Angels & Airwaves, however, and the finished product -- simply titled Love -- was released free of charge on Valentine's Day 2010. The second part of Love arrived in November 2011, not long after DeLonge released his reunion album with blink-182, along with a set that combined both parts of the album.\r\nThe next stage of Angels & Airwaves began in April 2014, when DeLonge announced plans for another ambitious multimedia project. During the recording of the album, bassist Wachter left the band and was replaced by ex-Thrice member Eddie Breckenridge. The new album, entitled The Dream Walker, appeared in early December; it debuted at 39 on the Billboard 200. Also in 2014, blink-182 were purportedly in the planning stages of recording another album. However, in 2015, Hoppus and Barker revealed to Rolling Stone that they had parted ways with DeLonge and replaced the guitarist with Alkaline Trio's Matt Skiba. DeLonge then responded on social media that any decision for the band to move forward was made without him.\r\nFollowing the split with blink-182, DeLonge revealed that he would release two Angels & Airwaves albums -- as well as two solo efforts -- in 2015. He managed to release a single Angels & Airwaves EP in September (...Of Nightmares) as well as his first solo album, To the Stars: Demos, Odds and Ends, which featured demos recorded for both blink-182 and Angels & Airwaves projects. The second promised Angels & Airwaves effort was issued in April 2016. The Chasing Shadows EP debuted in the Billboard 200 at number 109 and was paired with a novel of the same name, written by DeLonge and A.J. Hartley.\r\nThe group returned three years later with a new lineup -- DeLonge and Kennedy were joined by drummer Ilan Rubin (NIN, Paramore) and bassist Matt Rubano -- and a new label, Rise Records. They issued the synth-washed single \"Rebel Girl\" later that year, with \"All That's Left Is Love\" arriving in 2020. The former track eventually landed on their sixth official set, 2021's Lifeforms. Produced by the band and Aaron Rubin, the album also included the singles \"Euphoria\" and \"Spellbound.\" ~ Corey Apar & Andrew Leahey",

    summary: "This technical death metal outfit from Vancouver embodies elements of deathcore, grindcore, and even some progressive metal tendencies underneath its angular attack fueled by the twin-guitar pyrotechnics of eight-string guitarist Dean Lamb and seven-string guitarist Tobi Morelli, with vocalist/lyricist Oliver Rae Aleron, drummer Spencer Prewett, and bassist Jared Smith (the only non-original member). Though they record infrequently, they tour and rehearse almost constantly. Their sophisticated musical character offers blistering guitar riffs, prodigious six- and four-string sweeps, and tapping amid syncopated prog drumming and filthy vocals. While these characteristics were initially showcased on 2011's All Shall Align and 2014's tech-death textbook offering The Lucid Collective after Smith's arrival in 2016, they created a wholly individual, signature attack for 2017's Restless Mutation and gelled on 2021's raucous Bleed the Future.\r\nFounded in 2009 by vocalist Oliver Rae Aleron and drummer Spencer Prewett, the guitarists joined shortly thereafter along with bassist Jaron Evil (ex-Funeral Fornication), although he left the band after its debut full-length All Shall Align in 2011. Due to the technical facility of the band's guitar players, Evil hadn't been replaced when the band signed to Seasons of Mist to issue their sophomore outing, The Lucid Collective, in 2014; Clayton Harder assisted the group on tour. Six-string bassist Jared Smith (ex-Civil Ruin and Harvest the Infection) joined the group permanently in January of 2016 and their sound began to evolve almost immediately. Archspire dove into writing as a quintet for the band's third effort, Relentless Mutation, which was issued in September of 2017. The album peaked inside the top of the Independent Albums chart.\r\nIn 2019, the band made international tech news when internationally renowned guerilla programming duo Dadabots created a neural network that was trained on Archspire's music and produced a non-stop stream of technical death metal, all based on the band's original music. Dadabots' public reasoning was that Archspire's songs produced the most consistent artificial intelligence due to their machine-like precision drumming and shard-like guitars. In October 2021, the quintet issued Bleed the Future. Recorded at Denver's Flatline Audio, it was produced, recorded, mixed, and mastered by studio owner and ace metal drummer Dave Otero. ~ Thom Jurek",

    summary: "A metal institution whose influence cannot be overstated, Black Sabbath pioneered the genre as they constructed the framework for subsequent subgenres within metal, with entire movements rising from blueprints laid out in single Sabbath songs. From the end of the 1960s and throughout the entirety of the '70s, the band became legendary for the doomy chemistry between its players: Ozzy Osbourne's primal vocals, Tony Iommi's seismic riffing, Bill Ward's bluntly powerful drumming, and Geezer Butler's thunderous basslines all congealed into a sinister breed of hard rock and occult-fixated songcraft the world had never heard before. This untouchable original lineup was responsible for metal masterpieces like 1970's Paranoid, but when they splintered in 1979, Black Sabbath soldiered on with a cast of various different singers -- most notably Ronnie James Dio for a pair of albums in the '80s -- while Osbourne applied his prince of darkness persona to a successful solo career that would span decades. There were various reunions and partial re-formations of the first Black Sabbath lineup, aiming to recapture some of their early evil energy on later-period outings like 2013's 13.\r\nThe band formed in Birmingham, England, in 1968 under the ill-fitting name the Polka Tulk Blues Band -- Iommi and Ward, who had just left the pub-blues outfit Mythology, were looking to take the genre in a more robust direction. They enlisted the services of Butler and Osbourne, both of whom had played together in a group called Rare Breed, and by the end of the year they were operating under the moniker Earth. The transition from Earth to Black Sabbath took place the following year, after Osbourne and Butler penned a song that was inspired by the 1963 Boris Karloff horror film of the same name. The resulting \"Black Sabbath,\" a funereal slab of blast furnace-forged dread built around the augmented fourth/tritonic interval, better known as the devil's interval, would serve as the opening volley on their explosive eponymous 1970 debut. Released on Vertigo Records, the more progressive subsidiary of Philips/Phonogram, the bulk of the Rodger Bain-produced LP was recorded in a single day. Only a handful of guitar overdubs -- Iommi's signature sound was lent considerable gravitas by the fact that he tuned his guitar a half-step down to provide some slack for a pair of fingers that saw their tips removed in a factory accident -- along with the rain, thunder, and tolling bells that so effectively introduced the group to the world, would be added later. The record was released on Friday the 13th, which helped kick-start the band's reputation for populating the fertile crime scene that is history with plenty of blood spatter. Flush with eventual genre classics like \"The Wizard,\" \"N.I.B.,\" and the aforementioned title cut, Black Sabbath was initially dismissed by critics -- retrospective reviews were far more reverent -- but it managed to reach the U.K. Top Ten and hold court for over a year on the U.S. Top 40, eventually being certified platinum.\r\nWith the surprise success of Black Sabbath, the band wasted little time in getting back into the studio. Released just seven months after their debut, Paranoid, the very antithesis of the sophomore slump, would spawn two of their biggest singles in \"Iron Man\" and the nervy, hard-hitting title track, the latter of which would be the band's only Top Ten hit -- the LP went straight to the top of the U.K. charts and sold over four million copies in the U.S. Deeper yet no less immediate cuts like the air-raid siren-led, politically charged \"War Pigs\" and the trippy, mellow doom anthem \"Planet Caravan\" revealed a group that had far more creative gas in the tank than their detractors would have cared to admit. Paranoid also afforded Sabbath their first measure of controversy after an inquest was made regarding an American nurse who committed suicide while listening to the LP; for many, the name Black Sabbath would become synonymous with Satanism throughout the '70s and '80s.\r\nSabbath continued to blow the unholy horn of plenty with albums three and four. Released in 1971, the brutish Master of Reality was certified double platinum on the strength of fan favorites like \"Sweet Leaf,\" \"Children of the Grave,\" and \"Into the Void,\" the latter two of which saw Iommi downtune three semitones in order to release even more string tension -- Butler followed suit, and the deep-earth pummeling that followed has been widely cited as the auger of sludge, doom, and stoner metal. The LP also featured the Iommi-composed, Butler-penned \"After Forever,\" which, much to the confusion of some of the band's more zealous critics, reflected the bass player's deep Catholic faith. Vol. 4, recorded in Los Angeles, arrived the following year and was the first Sabbath outing without Rodger Bain handling production duties -- Iommi and then-manager Patrick Meehan would co-produce the album. Certainly the group's most ambitious outing to date, Vol. 4 also represented Black Sabbath at their most chemically dependent -- the album's working title was Snowblind -- shipping in speaker boxes filled with cocaine, and turning their rented Bel Air house into a boozy black cauldron of rock star excess. Nevertheless, they managed to stay just-in-control long enough to piece together a dark, introspective gem of a record that didn't spawn any hits -- the caustic riff-gasm that is \"Supernaut\" must have charted in some other more forgiving dimension -- but still topped the album charts. Vol. 4 dutifully reflected Sabbath's debauched collective headspace at the time but retained enough of the blue-collar might that fueled their early works to connect.\r\nArriving in 1973, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath was another success, doubling down on the more progressive elements of Vol. 4, even going so far as to tap Rick Wakeman from Yes to contribute keyboards to the track \"Sabbra Cadabra.\" Bolstered by the now-iconic title cut as well as the punishing \"Killing Yourself to Live,\" the LP not only resonated with fans but elicited positive comments from mainstream critics as well, becoming Sabbath's fifth platinum album in the U.S. and earning their first silver certification in the U.K. Sabotage, released in 1975, saw the band returning to the bottom-heavy, molten-metal attack of their debut, for the most part dialing back on the orchestral flourishes and studio trickery of their last two outings. It also arrived in the midst of contentious litigation between the band and their now-former manager Meehan. Between the bruising \"Hole in the Sky,\" the angst-fueled \"Symptom of the Universe,\" and the nearly nine-minute epic \"The Writ,\" the band sounded both reinvigorated and wrecked, like a bloodied beast filled with bullets, standing on the corpse of its captor. Fans and critics were kind, but the musical climate was changing both at home and abroad, and Black Sabbath were beginning to feel the chill.\r\nBy 1976 the band was undergoing an internal struggle as well, having to contend with an increasingly frustrated and chemically dependent frontman who was looking to strike out on his own. Technical Ecstasy (1976) and Never Say Die! (1978), despite going gold, suffered beneath the weight of both the band's substance abuse issues and their increasingly diminished position in popular music. Bands like the Clash and the Sex Pistols were on the rise, and Sabbath's brand of stalwart heavy blues-rock was losing favor. During the recording of Never Say Die!, Osbourne quit, eventually making his way back into the fold during the final sessions, but in 1979, after touring in support of the album, he was fired from the group for good.\r\nOsbourne's departure and successful solo career may have signaled the end of an era for the group, but Black Sabbath weren't about to go gently into that good night. At the suggestion of the band's new manager's daughter Sharon Arden (later to become Sharon Osbourne), Iommi, Butler, and Ward brought in ex-Rainbow frontman Ronnie James Dio to take over vocal duties. Dio's powerful voice, as idiosyncratic and iconic as Osbourne's but with a far more wholesale appeal, proved the perfect fit for Black Sabbath 2.0. Released in 1980, Heaven and Hell was a critical and commercial success, becoming their third-highest-selling LP after Paranoid and Master of Reality. That same year, while on tour, Ward had reached the apex of his alcoholism and announced that he too was leaving the group. Vinny Appice, the younger brother of legendary Vanilla Fudge drummer Carmine Appice, was brought in to replace him, and would appear on the group's tenth studio outing, 1981's Mob Rules. The album received mixed reviews, but still managed to go gold in the U.S. and crack the U.K. Top 40 on the strength of the fiery title track, which also appeared -- in a different version -- in the cult animated, adult-fantasy film Heavy Metal.\r\nBlack Sabbath's first-ever concert album, Live Evil, was released in 1983. Recorded during the group's 1982 tour in support of Mob Rules, it presented an audio snapshot of the band at the peak of their technical powers, but failed to capture the internal tensions that were bubbling beneath all of the pick slides and pyrotechnics. Citing an irreconcilable falling out with Iommi and Butler, Dio and Appice left the group in the middle of mixing the album and formed their own band. With the newly minted Dio issuing Holy Diver and Osbourne releasing his third chart-topping solo LP, Bark at the Moon, Black Sabbath were at a definite crossroads.\r\nUndeterred, Iommi and Butler immediately began looking for new members with whom to start up the old machinery, eventually settling on Deep Purple's Ian Gillan on vocals and a freshly sober Bill Ward behind the kit. While it sold well initially, the resulting Born Again was a critical failure, a tone-deaf collection of subpar Sabbath tropes that would ultimately leave Iommi the last man standing. Even the tour in support of the album was a disaster, with Ward, who relapsed during recording, being replaced by Move/ELO drummer Bev Bevan, and a cringe-inducing prop malfunction providing the inspiration for the 1984 mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap's now-classic Stonehenge sequence. After the tour, Bevan left, Gillan rejoined Deep Purple, and Butler went solo, leaving Iommi no choice but to put the band on hiatus.\r\nWhat followed was a long period of near-constant personnel changes, with Iommi remaining the sole original member. Issued in 1986, the bluesy Seventh Star was, for all intents and purposes, an Iommi solo album -- record company pressure forced him to add the Black Sabbath moniker to the front cover -- and 1987's Eternal Idol was the first to feature new semi-permanent vocalist Tony Martin. Hard rock heavyweight drummer Cozy Powell joined Iommi and Martin on 1989's Headless Cross and 1990's Viking-themed concept album Tyr, but none of the initial post-Born Again LPs had much of an impact critically or commercially. Once again, the musical paradigm was shifting away from the hard rock/heavy metal genre, and Sabbath were just trying to stay afloat. The generally well-received Dehumanizer, a Heaven and Hell/Mob Rules-era reunion with Butler, Dio, and Vinny Appice, provided the Black Sabbath name with a much-needed shot in the arm in 1992, and managed to sneak them back into the Top 40 both at home and overseas, but it would prove to be a one-off affair. Arriving in 1994, Cross Purposes kept Butler on board and brought back Martin on vocals, but it failed to capitalize on any momentum left over from Dehumanizer's success, and the following year's disappointing Forbidden, the band's 18th studio LP, would be the last outing for Martin, as well as the last studio album from the band for nearly 18 years.\r\nIommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne would eventually make their way back under the stage lights in 1997, culminating in the release of the Best Metal Performance Grammy Award-winning double-live LP Reunion, but it would be 16 years -- and a whole lot of Ozzy, who was eventually given his own reality television show -- before the band would bring the dark arts back to the recording studio. Released in 2013, the Rick Rubin-produced 13, which also brought home a Grammy, this time for the single \"God Is Dead?,\" would be Black Sabbath's final album, and in 2015, Osbourne, Iommi, and Butler (Ward refused to participate) announced that their upcoming world tour would be their last. The aptly named The End Tour, which concluded in their hometown of Birmingham, saw Black Sabbath closing the coffin lid on a nearly 50-year career and cementing their legacy as the unheralded harbingers of heavy, sludge, stoner, and doom metal. A concert LP/film of the performance was released in 2017. ~ James Christopher Monger & Fred Thomas",

    summary: "Thanks to their hooky, high-energy, often humorous, songs, blink-182 have been one of the most prominent pop-punk bands since gaining mainstream success in the early 2000s. The trio (whose best-known lineup featured bassist/singer Mark Hoppus, guitarist/singer Tom DeLonge, and drummer Travis Barker) stood out from the teen pop and nu-metal that dominated the airwaves, breaking through with their third album, 1999's Enema of the State,  and releasing a steady stream of hits bolstered by tongue-in-cheek music videos. The band's popularity helped propel their follow-up, 2001's Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, to number one on the Billboard 200. Since that time, blink-182 have remained chart favorites, scoring Top Ten Billboard 200 albums that include 2003's blink-182, 2011's Neighborhoods, and 2016's California. DeLonge left the band in 2015 (replaced by Alkaline Trio's Matt Skiba), but he ultimately came back for 2023's One More Time…,  a cathartic return to form that coincided with pop-punk's resurgence.\r\nBlink-182 formed in the suburbs of San Diego around guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge, bassist/vocalist Mark Hoppus, and drummer Scott Raynor. Originally known as simply Blink, the band debuted in 1993 with the self-released EP Fly Swatter. After releasing the album Buddha in 1994, the trio signed to Grilled Cheese/Cargo and released Cheshire Cat the following year. The threat of a lawsuit from a similarly named Irish band forced them to change their name to blink-182, but that did not slow them down: the group earned a higher profile by touring the world with Pennywise and NOFX on the 1996-1997 Warped Tour, in addition to appearing on innumerable skate/surf/snowboarding videos.\r\nThe third blink-182 LP, Dude Ranch, was jointly released in 1997 by Cargo and MCA. Dude Ranch expanded the group's audience and went platinum by the end of 1998, due in part to the popularity of the infectious teen anthem \"Dammit (Growing Up).\" The group also officially signed with MCA, which released the band's fourth album, Enema of the State, in the summer of 1999. The album, produced by Jerry Finn (Green Day, Rancid), also welcomed a new member into the trio's ranks; Travis Barker, formerly with the Aquabats, settled in on drums after Raynor left midway through a 1998 U.S. tour. Enema was greeted with almost immediate success, and helped the band achieve the mainstream status of toilet-humored pop-punk kings that Dude Ranch had only hinted at. Driven by the commercially successful singles \"What's My Age Again?,\" \"All the Small Things,\" and \"Adam's Song,\" music videos for the three songs (whose clips included themes of streaking and boy band spoofs) were MTV smashes as well.\r\nAfter selling over four million copies of Enema of the State, the trio played on with the limited-edition release The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back) in fall 2000. The album featured their radio hits in a live setting, intertwined with their quirky sense of humor as well as the new song \"Man Overboard.\" Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, issued in spring 2001, saw the band return to their SoCal punk roots and became their first number one album in the U.S. Maturity, of a sort, came with 2003's self-titled album, released on Geffen. Not only did the album sport a song (\"All of This\") that featured Robert Smith of the Cure, but \"I Miss You\" also topped the modern rock chart in 2005. In February of 2005, however, popular as ever and seemingly indestructible, blink-182 unexpectedly announced they would be going on an \"indefinite hiatus,\" supposedly to spend more time with their growing families. Asking fans for help in selecting tracks, the group issued Greatest Hits that November.\r\nThe bandmembers also continued with other projects. Barker -- who had previously released an album with DeLonge as Boxcar Racer -- continued playing with the Transplants and running his clothing company, Famous Stars and Straps. His family was also spotlighted in the MTV reality show Meet the Barkers. Hoppus carried on with his Atticus fashion venture and began producing -- starting with Motion City Soundtrack's Commit This to Memory -- and hosting his own podcasts. He further began work with Barker in a new band, Plus 44. DeLonge also continued work with his lifestyle clothing company Macbeth, and formally announced his new project, Angels and Airwaves, that fall.\r\nWhile still on hiatus in 2008, the group endured a handful of personal setbacks including the death of longtime producer Jerry Finn, who suffered a brain hemorrhage and subsequent heart attack; he was eventually taken off life support and passed away that August. In September, both Barker and frequent collaborator DJ AM were seriously injured in a plane crash in which both pilots and two of Barker's associates died. It ultimately took 11 months for Barker to fully recover from his injuries and led to the drummer suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The crash prompted Hoppus and DeLonge to reconnect with Barker in support of his recovery, and in 2009, blink-182 announced that they were reuniting, hitting the road with Weezer for their reunion tour. They went into the studio later that year and began laying down the groundwork for a new album, which would be plagued by delays until 2011, when they were eventually able to release their sixth studio effort, Neighborhoods.\r\nDespite growing evidence of friction within the band, blink-182 toured throughout much of the rest of 2011, joining My Chemical Romance, Rancid, and Against Me! on the tenth annual Honda Civic Tour. A 20th anniversary tour found the group members appearing together again in 2012. Later that year, blink-182 parted with Interscope, a transition they marked by the release of their self-produced Dogs Eating Dogs EP.\r\nFollowing a string of sold-out dates in Los Angeles in 2013, as well as headlining appearances at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2014, blink-182 began discussions concerning a follow-up to Neighborhoods. However, in January 2015, Hoppus and Barker were quoted in Rolling Stone saying that DeLonge had left the band and announcing the possibility that Alkaline Trio's Matt Skiba would fill in for the guitarist at future shows. DeLonge quickly responded on Facebook that he had not quit blink-182, and that any decision for the band to move forward was made without him. In the end, Skiba officially joined blink-182, and the group entered the studio at the end of the year to begin recording new songs. The first taste from the new trio was \"Bored to Death,\" which was released in April 2016. Their seventh LP, California, arrived that summer and debuted at number one, just before they embarked on a tour featuring All Time Low, A Day to Remember, and All-American Rejects. That same year, blink-182 also released the career-spanning vinyl anthology Box Set, which featured all six of the band's studio albums prior to California.\r\nThe group returned to the studio to begin recording a follow-up and, in the years between blink releases, tended to their other musical responsibilities. Skiba recorded another album with Alkaline Trio, while Barker added numerous collaborations to his ever-expanding résumé, including work with Yungblud, Machine Gun Kelly, XXXTentacion, and others. Meanwhile, Hoppus debuted Simple Creatures, his side project with All Time Low's Alex Gaskarth, and released a pair of EPs. In 2019, blink-182 delivered their aptly titled ninth set (according to Barker and Hoppus), Nine. Despite a bright and colorful album cover, Nine featured dark lyrical content stemming from Hoppus' struggles with depression. The LP included the singles \"Blame It on My Youth\" and \"Happy Days.\" A stand-alone single, \"Quarantine,\" appeared in 2020.\r\nIn June 2021, Hoppus announced he had been diagnosed with lymphoma and had already begun treatment. Later that year, he was declared cancer-free. In the wake of his recovery, DeLonge rejoined joined the band with a possible studio album and tour already in the works. In October 2022, the reunited trio released the Barker-produced \"Edging,\" the first song to feature DeLonge since 2012. It debuted at number 12 on Billboard's Alternative Airplay Chart and spent 13 weeks at number one.\r\nFollowing the single's release, blink-182 began ramping up for their World Tour 2023/2024, aka The Rock Hard Tour. However, their plans were postponed by several months due to Barker sustaining a finger injury in February 2023. That April, they surprised fans with an unannounced live performance at Coachella, marking DeLonge's first performance with the group in almost a decade. Two days later, they again performed at the festival, taking over headlining duties. While on tour, they debuted two more singles, \"One More Time\" and \"More Than You Know,\" which heralded the band's ninth studio album. Released in October 2023, the Barker-produced One More Time... was blink-182's first full-length album to feature the classic lineup of Hoppus, DeLonge, and Barker since 2011's Neighborhoods. It topped both the Billboard 200 and Top Modern Rock/Alternative Albums charts. A deluxe version of the album, One More Time...Part 2, arrived in September 2024 and featured eight additional songs including the single, \"All in My Head.\" ~ John Bush & Corey Apar",

    summary: "Serving as a side project for Blink 182 members Travis Barker and Thomas DeLonge, Boxcar Racer is a return to a more traditional punk sound. Adding guitarist David Kennedy and bassist Anthony Celestino, the group came together between Blink 182 sessions and recorded their eponymous album in the winter of 2001/2002. Cutting much of the pop from their usual sound and showing diverse influences like the Replacements and D.R.I., the band used it as a showcase for the material they wrote that wasn't Blink-friendly. ~ Bradley Torreano",

They continued to push against the boundaries of progressive metalcore on subsequent albums The Way It Ends and The Death We Seek.\r\nCurrents began operations in 2011 and spent the next few years finding their voice, eventually settling on a crew that included Brian Wille (vocals), Jeff Brown (drums), Chris Wiseman (guitar), Ryan Castaldi (guitar), and Dee Cronkite (bass). Drawing inspiration from bands like Meshuggah, Architects, and Structures, the newly minted five-piece issued a pair of independent EPs (2013's Victimized and 2015's Life//Lost), and then spent two years piecing together and honing the material that would make up their debut album. The resulting The Place I Feel Safest arrived in 2017 on SharpTone Records, with an EP, I Let the Devil In, appearing one year later.\r\nIn early 2020, Currents began issuing singles, including the punishing \"Poverty of Self,\" ahead of the release of their sophomore effort. The Way It Ends, which featured a revised lineup consisting of Wille, Wiseman, Castaldi, Chris Pulgarin (bass), and Matt Young (drums), arrived later that June, with an instrumental version appearing the following year. 2023's \"Remember Me,\" a potent and hard-hitting song detailing the struggles of maintaining relationships in the social media age, served as the lead single on the group's third full-length outing, The Death We Seek. ~ James Christopher Monger",

    summary: "Volatile post-hardcore outfit Dance Gavin Dance deliver thrashing, emo-leaning anthems performed over the years by a frequently shifting lineup anchored by stalwarts Will Swan (lead guitar, vocals) and Matt Mingus (drums). Signed to Rise Records since their 2006 debut, the Sacramento-based band steadily climbed the charts over a series of albums and mainstream success found them in the mid-2010s. Ten years into their career, 2016's Mothership landed at number 13 on the Billboard 200 with its 2018 follow-up, Artificial Selection, performing nearly as well at number 15. Dance Gavin Dance headed into their next decade with 2020's Afterburner and, following more lineup changes, 2022's Jackpot Juicer.\r\nFormed in 2005, the band originally comprised vocalists Jonny Craig and Jonathan Mess, guitarists Will Swan and Sean O'Sullivan, bassist Eric Lodge, and drummer Matt Mingus. Based on their self-released debut EP Whatever I Say Is Royal Ocean, Dance Gavin Dance signed with Rise Records in 2006 who then remastered and re-released the EP. Their first full-length, Downtown Battle Mountain, arrived the next year featuring production Kris Crummett who would go on to become a frequent collaborator with the band. Before releasing their self-titled sophomore follow-up in 2008, Craig left the band and was briefly replaced by Kurt Travis. Mess and Lodge also parted ways with the band, with Swan taking over screaming vocals and Jason Ellis as the new bassist. Happiness, their third album, was released in 2009. The lineup changes continued the next year, with Mess and Lodge returning; they brought along guitarist Josh Benton. Jonny Craig returned for a moment, relieving Travis of his vocal duties. That incarnation of the band released Downtown Battle Mountain II, the sequel to their debut. The reunion wouldn't last long, however, as Craig split yet again in 2012. Tilian Pearson (ex-Tides of Man) was brought on in 2013, just in time for their fifth album, Acceptance Speech. By this point Tim Feerick had become the band's full-time bassist.\r\nDuring this tumultuous period, Dance Gavin Dance maintained a steady ascent of the Billboard charts and their sixth album, 2015's Instant Gratification, made it all the way to number 32. This set the table for a successful tenth anniversary tour later that year. 2016 brought their second live album, Tree City Sessions, which included material from each of their six albums and marked the return of Josh Benton on guitar and production duties. A few months later, Dance Gavin Dance's seventh LP, Mothership, debuted at 13 on the Billboard 200. Now working with a steady lineup, the group recorded their eighth album, Artificial Selection, in 2018. The effort featured singles \"Son of a Robot\" and \"Care,\" as well as guest vocalists Andrew Wells (\"Evaporate\") and former bandmate Travis (\"Shelf Life\"). They followed this with a remastered instrumental re-release of their 2013 album, packaged as Acceptance Speech 2.0. However, it wasn't long before they were recording more original material, which surfaced in the form of their tenth studio album, Afterburner; the record saw a number of returning guests, including Wells, Strawberry Girls' Zachary Garren, and Veil of Maya's Marc Okubo. They also released a follow-up to their 2016 live album in Tree City Sessions 2. Wells, who had served as a guest and touring member, was officially inducted into the band in 2021. During the tumultuous front half of 2022, Dance Gavin Dance endured the departure of vocalist and the sudden death of bassist Tim Feerick. Both appeared on the band's tenth album, Jackpot Juicer, when it was released in July. ~ Corey Apar & Neil Z. Yeung",

    summary: "A metalcore group based out of Florida, A Day to Remember draws from a wide array of genres including emo, pop-punk, hardcore, and heavy metal -- affectionately referred to by their fans as \"pop mosh.\" Debuting in 2005 with And Their Name Was Treason, the band caught fire with the releases of Homesick (2009) and What Separates Me from You (2010), both of which were certified gold. Despite enduring myriad changes in personnel and label woes, they continued to hone their signature \"easycore\" sound on the Top Five release Bad Vibrations (2016) and You're Welcome (2021).\r\nHailing from Ocala, Florida, vocalist Jeremy McKinnon, guitarists Neil Westfall and Tom Denney, bassist Joshua Woodard, and drummer Bobby Scruggs financed their first EP themselves, then signed with Indianola Records for the release of their full-length And Their Name Was Treason in spring 2005. The record went on to sell over 8,000 copies through word of mouth alone, and a year later the guys were signed to Chicago powerhouse Victory Records. Work quickly began on their label debut; For Those Who Have Heart appeared in January 2007, featuring new drummer Alex Shelnutt. Homesick, A Day to Remember's sophomore release, arrived in October 2009. After Homesick, Tom Denney left the band (although he remained part of the writing process) while Kevin Skaff (from Four Letter Lie) assumed the guitar duties.\r\nThe group's fourth studio album, What Separates Me from You, was released in late 2010, reaching gold status on the strength of the single \"All I Want.\" In 2011, the bandmembers found themselves involved in a dispute with Victory that eventually led to a lawsuit, the result of which allowed A Day to Remember to self-release their fifth full-length, Common Courtesy, in 2013. The album peaked at number 37 on the Billboard 200, and charted internationally, earning near-universal accolades from both fans and critics. Bad Vibrations, the group's Epitaph-issued follow-up, arrived in 2016 and debuted at number two in the United States. The same year saw the band receive the keys to their hometown of Ocala.\r\nADTR moved to Fueled by Ramen for their seventh studio long-player, You're Welcome, which was originally scheduled for 2019 but eventually bumped to early 2021. Incorporating pop sheen into metalcore muscle, the set collected singles spanning 2019 (\"Resentment,\" \"Degenerate\") to 2020 (\"Mindreader,\" \"Brick Wall\"), landing at number 15 on the Billboard 200 upon release. A remix of the You're Welcome track \"Re-entry,\" featuring blink-182's Mark Hoppus, appeared in 2022. That year they hit the Top 25 of the Mainstream Rock chart with the non-album single \"Miracle.\" ~ Eduardo Rivadavia",

    summary: "There are four bands with this name; 1) Dealer — a nu-metalcore band from Melbourne, Australia. 2) Dealer, formed in Cirencester (UK) in 1979, was a NWOBHM band. 3) DEALER, founded in 1999, made their way through deserts, over mountains and through deep valleys, with a heart for Rock 'n' Roll and a six-string to state it. This four-piece is rooted in several corners of Rock music. Finally the guys find themselves rockin' out like the Rolling Stones in fury, Deep Purple in anger and a bunch of Austrian shepherds on magic mushrooms. In 2006 Dealer released their 2nd long-player \"Backdoor Business“, with a focus on classic song-writing and an attitude and a curtesy to the great ones, the mean.

    summary: "As one of the progenitors of the '90s nu-metal movement, Deftones embrace their individual influences to create an artistic, alternative metal hybrid that balances beauty and brutality. As one of the first groups to alternate heavy riffs and screamed vocals with more ethereal music and hushed singing, they quickly evolved beyond the nu-metal scene, influencing a generation of musicians with their trio of platinum-certified early albums: 1995's Adrenaline, 1997's Around the Fur, and 2000's seminal White Pony. In the 2000s and 2010s, they pushed their sonic boundaries even further, departing from mainstream-friendly song structures in favor of increasingly expansive atmospherics on sets like 2003's self-titled effort, 2010's Diamond Eyes, and 2016's Gore. In 2020, they kicked off their fourth decade as a unit with their ninth album, Ohms.\r\nThe group formed in Sacramento, California in 1988, when then high-school students Stephen Carpenter (guitar), Abe Cunningham (drums), and Chino Moreno (vocals) first began to jam together. They chose the name Deftones and began playing out locally shortly thereafter, going through several different bass players before finding a permanent bassist in the form of Chi Cheng. Although the group were more heavy metal-based early on, the early '90s saw Deftones expand their sound even further, inspired by such groundbreakers as Tool, Rage Against the Machine, and Faith No More. A strong four-song demo was completed soon after, and it landed the band a recording contract with Madonna's label, Maverick.\r\nEnlisting the services of Soundgarden and Pantera producer Terry Date (who would eventually become a regular producer for the group), the quartet's debut full-length, Adrenaline, was issued in October 1995. While the album wasn't an instant success, Deftones built a dedicated fan base the old-fashioned way -- by touring relentlessly (both on their own and opening for more established acts such as Ozzy Osbourne, L7, and Korn). With sales of Adrenaline topping 200,000 copies, expectations were high for their sophomore release, Around the Fur. Issued in October 1997, it more than delivered, catapulting the band to the top of the alt-metal mountain on the strength of such MTV/radio faves as \"My Own Summer (Shove It)\" and \"Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away).\" Sometime after the record's release, turntablist/keyboardist Frank Delgado (who had helped out on the first two albums) formally joined up and expanded the group's lineup to a five-piece.\r\nA seven-track import EP, 1999's Live, was issued as a stopgap release as Deftones began work on their third studio effort (Cheng issued a spoken word release, The Bamboo Parachute, around this time as well). White Pony was eventually released in June 2000 and proved to be one of the most eagerly anticipated heavy rock releases of the year. The album was another success (debuting at number three on the album charts), and it showed the quintet unafraid to experiment with their sound, as Moreno let such '80s modern rock influences as the Cure and the Smiths seep into Deftones' sound. (After touring wrapped up for the album, Moreno formed Team Sleep and began recording an eponymous album, which was delayed numerous times but finally saw release in 2005.)\r\nSoon Deftones reunited to work on new ideas, and enlisted Date again to helm their new album. Eagerly anticipated by both fans and critics alike, Deftones dropped in May 2003 and spawned the single \"Minerva.\" The quintet then embarked on the Summer Sanitarium tour with Metallica and Linkin Park. Deftones ended up peaking at number two on the Billboard 200, and the band took a well-deserved break for rest and side projects. In October 2005, Deftones issued a two-disc set of B-sides and rarities before returning with a new studio full-length, Saturday Night Wrist, a year later.\r\nIn 2007, the group began working on Eros, which was set to be their sixth album. The record was delayed indefinitely when bassist Chi Cheng was involved in a serious car accident that left him in a coma. Cheng's spot was filled by Quicksand bassist Sergio Vega in 2009, and the band got back to touring and recording. Though Eros was still shelved, in 2010 Deftones released a new album, Diamond Eyes. Cheng partially regained consciousness in 2012 and returned home to recover, though he wouldn't be in good enough shape to appear on the band's seventh album, Koi No Yokan, which arrived later that year. Despite his recovery, Cheng passed away from cardiac arrest on April 13, 2013, at age 42. In 2014, to mark the one-year anniversary of his death, Deftones released the track \"Smile,\" from the unreleased Eros.\r\nTwo years later, the band returned with their eighth album, Gore, released in April 2016. Their second-highest charting to date, the critically acclaimed record topped the charts in Australia and New Zealand while reaching number two in the U.S. In addition to the singles \"Prayers/Triangles\" and \"Hearts/Wires,\" the LP also included \"Phantom Bride,\" which featured a guest appearance by Jerry Cantrell. While touring in support of Gore, they were already starting to work on a follow-up, which appeared in 2020. Their ninth full-length, the Grammy-nominated Ohms also marked the return of producer Terry Date, the man behind their first four efforts (and the unreleased Eros). Another hit with critics, the set scored the band their fourth Top Five release. Soon after, Deftones capped their banner year with the release of the long-rumored White Pony remix album Black Stallion, which featured interpretations from the likes of DJ Shadow, Phantogram, Purity Ring, Squarepusher, Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda, and even Cure frontman Robert Smith. ~ Neil Z.

    summary: "Enter Shikari is an eclectic U.K. rock outfit that incorporates elements of post-hardcore, alternative rock, pop, and electronicore into their versatile and voltaic sound. The band found success early on with its 2007 debut album Take to the Skies going gold in the U.K. Since then, they have continued to make a name for themselves both at home and abroad, issuing a string of successful LPs like A Flash Flood of Colour (2012), Nothing Is True & Everything Is Possible (2020), and A Kiss for the Whole World (2023), that deliver a radio-ready amalgam of electro-pop, grime, and post-hardcore-influenced dance-rock that's as consistently surprising as it is sonically invigorating.\r\nEnter Shikari formed in Hertfordshire, England in 2003 from the remnants of the group Hybryd, whose original lineup comprised vocalist Rou Reynolds, guitarist Liam \"Rory\" Clewlow, bassist Chris Batten, and drummer Rob Rolfe. In June 2003, Enter Shikari issued the demo EP Nodding Acquaintance, which they sold at gigs and via their website. The success of two additional self-released EPs, Sorry, You're Not a Winner and 2004's Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour, further developed their growing fan base and cemented the band's decision to go it alone, rejecting the overtures of major labels. As Enter Shikari continued their relentless live schedule, they also embraced the social networking website MySpace, and in 2006 secured a spot at the Gibson/MySpace stage at the annual Download Festival. That same summer, the group founded its own record label, Ambush Reality, and issued the digital-only single \"Mothership.\" At year's end, Enter Shikari were just the second unsigned band to sell out the famed London Astoria.\r\nIn March 2007, they issued their first proper LP, Take to the Skies, which entered the British Top Five on the strength of the smash single \"Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour.\" In April of 2009 the single \"Juggernauts\" announced the coming of their second album, Common Dreads, which appeared in June of that year. The band set out on tour at home and abroad before settling down in Bangkok, Thailand to work on new material with producer (and former Sikth guitarist) Dan Weller in 2011. Their third album, A Flash Flood of Colour, was released in early 2012. They returned to the studio with Weller after a heavy touring schedule in 2013 to work on new material for their fourth studio album. During the recording process they joined the Warped Tour, as well as appearing on the bill for the Reading and Leeds Festivals in 2014. Toward the end of the year, the four-piece announced the release of The Mindsweep, which arrived in January 2015. At the end of that year, the group recorded the Live and Acoustic from Alexandra Palace EP in a seldom-seen part of the legendary London venue, before their full \"arena show\" in February of 2016. A recording of the show was released at the end of 2016, featuring 16 of Enter Shikari's hits drawn from their back catalog. To close out the year, they released two stand-alone singles, \"Redshift\" and \"Hoodwinker,\" before calling an end to the Mindsweep era of the band. Early 2017 saw them play an extensive European tour, in part to mark the tenth anniversary of their debut album, Take to the Skies. As the tour drew to a close with a headlining show at the Slam Dunk Festival, they released the lead single from their new album; \"Supercharge\" demonstrated a change in direction by including elements of grime and a guest appearance from London MC Big Narstie, indicating that a broader mix of electronic genres would be featured on the album. The resulting LP, The Spark, arrived later that September. The band's subsequent tour of Europe, Japan, and North America produced two limited-edition live albums, Take to the Skies Live in Moscow May 2017 and Live at Alexandra Palace 2. Enter Shikari then returned to the studio to record their sixth album, with Rou Reynolds producing for the first time. Nothing Is True & Everything Is Possible, released in 2020, was an ambitious semi-concept piece featuring the most eclectic mix of styles the genre-bending band had yet utilized. The LP reached number two on the U.K. album charts.\r\nMoratorium (Broadcasts from the Interruption) appeared the following year and featured live and acoustic performances recorded remotely while the bandmembers were in lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They kicked off 2023 with the release of \"(Pls) Set Me on Fire,\" the first single from their seventh long-player, A Kiss for the Whole World, which arrived later that April. The album led to another round of touring, with many of the shows being recorded. The live rendtions would appear in an official capacity a year later, upon the release of Dancing on the Frontline, which also collated various remixes and bonus tracks into as a retrospective to everything post A Kiss for the Whole World. ~ Jason Ankeny",

    summary: "Often described as \"the spearhead of the whole modern progressive metalcore movement,\" Birmingham, Alabama's Erra combine the frontal assault of extreme metal with an adventurous sense of melody and precise stop-and-start arrangements. Emerging in the early 2010s, the technical metalcore band entered the mainstream in 2013 with the release of their sophomore effort, Augment, which topped the Billboard Heatseekers chart. They found similar success on subsequent efforts Drift (2016) and Neon (2018), and in 2024 they issued their sixth long-player, Cure.\r\nInfluenced by acts such as Misery Signals, As I Lay Dying, Born of Osiris, and Saosin, Erra were formed in 2009 by guitarist and clean vocalist Jesse Cash and scream vocalist Garrison Lee. Eager to move their musical ideas forward, Cash and Lee recruited their friends Adam Hicks and Alex Ballew to play bass and drums in the new group. The lineup was finalized when they discovered guitarist Alan Rigdon through his MySpace page, and they adopted the name Erra, a word referring to mayhem that can be traced back to the mythology of Akkad. In 2010, the group self-released their debut EP, Andromeda, and good reviews and an enthusiastic response from fans led to the band signing with indie label Tragic Hero Records.\r\nIn 2011, Erra released their first full-length album, Impulse, which along with extensive touring helped raise their profile on the independent metal scene, leading to tours alongside August Burns Red, Born of Osiris, and Tesseract. In 2012, bassist Adam Hicks announced he was leaving the group to focus on his education, but he stayed with Erra long enough to finish work on their second LP, Augment, which was released in the fall of 2013, and became their first album to chart. Sean Price took over on bass in 2012, and in 2014, he began trading off between bass and guitar with Jesse Cash following Alan Rigdon's departure from the group in 2014. 2014 also saw the departure of gritty vocalist Garrison Lee; Ian Eubanks filled the spot from 2014 to 2015, and J.T. Cavey became their howler in 2016.\r\nThe Moments of Clarity EP appeared during the transitional period in 2014, with their third studio long-player, the Sumerian-issued Drift, appearing in early 2016. The latter debuted at Number One on the U.S. Heatseekers chart, and 2018's well-received Neon managed the same feat. By this time, Conor Hesse had been installed as Erra's bassist. Erra parted ways with Sumerian in 2020 and made a lateral move to Australian heavy music label UNFD, which released their eponymous fifth full-length effort the following year. Sean Price left the lineup in 2022, and Clint Tustin joined in time for the sessions for Erra's sixth studio album, Cure, released in April 2024. The group celebrated the release with a tour running from April to June of that year, with support from Make Them Suffer, Void of Vision, and Novelists. When not on the road with Erra, Jesse Cash records and performs with his side project, Ghost Atlas. ~ Mark Deming",

    summary: "Along with No Doubt, Sublime, and Rancid, Los Angeles quartet Goldfinger helped contribute to a mini-U.S. ska-punk movement in the mid- to late '90s. The group was originally formed in 1994 by ex-Electric Love Hogs guitarist/singer John Feldmann and bassist/singer Simon Williams (who were both working at the same shoe store at the time), in addition to drummer Darrin Pfeiffer and an unnamed second guitarist (who would leave the group before any recordings could be issued and later become a pro surfer in Costa Rica). A friend of Feldmann's, Charlie Paulson, signed on shortly thereafter, playing his first show with the group just a day after being given a tape of their songs to learn.\r\nA six-track demo EP, Richter, was issued in 1995 and received favorable reviews and a substantial amount of airplay on college radio, leading to Goldfinger signing a major-label contract with Universal. Their self-titled full-length debut hit the record racks a year later, spawning the popular single/video \"Here in Your Bedroom\" (a track that originally appeared on their EP), and the group toured alongside the Sex Pistols, No Doubt, and Reel Big Fish, and performed at multi-band festival the Vans Warped Tour.\r\nTheir second full-length, Hang-Ups, was released in 1997, and although the album failed to live up to the expectations set by their debut, Goldfinger stayed in the public eye with their cover of the Spiral Starecase song \"More Today Than Yesterday,\" featured in the soundtrack of the hit Adam Sandler movie The Waterboy. Williams left the band in 1998, replaced by a former bandmate of Feldmann's from Electric Love Hogs, Kelly Lemieux, and Goldfinger debuted their new lineup with the eight-track all-covers live EP Darrin's Coconut Ass: Live a year later. The quartet's third studio release, Stomping Ground, was issued in 2000 as the group toured both Europe and the U.S. (during their tour of England, Goldfinger recorded one of their sets, issuing the live Foot in Mouth, available only at shows and through the band's official website).\r\nCome 2001, it was Paulson's turn to jump ship, replaced by Brian Arthur (formerly of the Texas alt-metal outfit Unloco), as Goldfinger's first studio album for their new label, Jive/Zomba, was issued in 2002 with Open Your Eyes. Disconnection Notice from 2005 found the group switching to the Maverick label. By 2008, however, Paulson was back on board, and the band released Hello Destiny... on the punk label SideOneDummy.\r\nOver the next several years, the band performed intermittently as Feldmann took on various production and songwriting projects including working with Panic! At the Disco, Allstar Weekend, 5 Seconds of Summer, blink-182, and others. Also during this period, bandmembers Paulson, Pfeiffer, and Lemieux parted ways with the band. In 2017, Goldfinger returned with The Knife, featuring contributions from blink-182 drummer Travis Barker, MxPx bassist Mike Herrera, Story of the Year guitarist Phil Sneed, and others. ~ Greg Prato",

    summary: "Since the early '90s, Bay Area trio Green Day has been one of the most celebrated and successful bands in the world, growing from an energetic and snarling pop-punk group into an increasingly melodic and stylistically adventurous act and infiltrating the mainstream early in the process. From the start, the band took notes from the anarchic attitudes and loud, fast, snotty approach of jittery late-'70s punk acts like the Jam and Sham 69, but elevated their blasting sound with pop elements like catchy hooks, tightly arranged song structures, and Beatlesque vocal harmonies. This winning combination made their 1994 major-label debut, Dookie, an enormous breakthrough hit, serving as an entry point to punk for many listeners who were coming of age when it first blasted up the charts. As they soldiered through the ensuing decades, Green Day matured without losing any of the lawless attitude they'd built their sound on, reaching a career peak with 2004's American Idiot (a sociopolitical rock opera and Grammy-winning international success). Over the years, Green Day expanded their sound to include nods to glam rock, soul, and larger-than-life arena rock, taking the time to make such detours as 2020's Father of All..., but they also found sustenance in their pop-punk, as indicated by 2024's rousing Saviors.\r\nGreen Day rose from the Northern California underground punk scene. Childhood friends Billie Joe Armstrong (guitar, vocals) and Mike Dirnt (bass) formed their first band, Sweet Children, in Rodeo, California when they were 14. By 1989, the group had added drummer Al Sobrante and changed its name to Green Day. That same year, the band independently released its first EP, 1000 Hours, which was well-received in the California hardcore punk scene. Debut full-length 39/Smooth and the Slappy EP arrived soon after in 1990. By 1991, the group had signed a contract with local independent label Lookout. Combining their first three efforts into one compilation, Green Day issued 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours for the label. Shortly after its release, they replaced Sobrante with Tre Cool (born Frank Edwin Wright III), who became the band's permanent drummer.\r\nThroughout the early '90s, Green Day continued to attract a cult following, which only gained strength with the release of their second album, 1992's Kerplunk. The underground success of Kerplunk led to a wave of interest from major record labels, and the band eventually decided to sign with Reprise. Dookie, Green Day's major-label debut, was released in the spring of 1994. Thanks to MTV's support of the initial single \"Longview,\" Dookie became a major hit. The album continued to gain momentum throughout the summer, with its second single, \"Basket Case,\" spending five weeks on top of the American modern rock charts. At the end of the summer, the band stole the show at Woodstock '94, which increased the sales of Dookie. By the time their fourth single, \"When I Come Around,\" began its seven-week stay at number one on the modern rock charts in early 1995, Dookie had sold over five million copies in the U.S. alone; it would eventually top ten million in America, selling over 15 million copies internationally. Dookie also won the 1994 Grammy for Best Alternative Music Performance.\r\nGreen Day quickly followed Dookie with Insomniac in the fall of 1995; during the summer, they hit number one again on the modern rock charts with \"J.A.R.,\" their contribution to the Angus soundtrack. Insomniac performed well initially, entering the U.S. charts at number two and selling over two million copies by the spring of 1996, yet none of its singles -- including the radio favorite \"Brain Stew/Jaded\" -- was as popular as those from Dookie. In the spring of 1996, Green Day abruptly canceled a European tour, claiming exhaustion. Following the cancellation, the band spent the rest of the year resting and writing new material before issuing Nimrod in late 1997. Three years later, their long-awaited follow-up, a refreshingly poppy record titled Warning, was released. Another long wait preceded 2004's American Idiot, an aggressive rock opera that became a surprise success -- a chart-topper around the world, a multi-platinum Grammy winner, and easily the best-reviewed album of their career. Green Day reveled in the album's success, hitting numerous award shows and performing as part of Live 8 in July 2005. That fall saw the release of Bullet in a Bible, a concert album that documented the trio's expansive Idiot live show.\r\nWith their popularity and commercial viability restored, Green Day took on several small projects before returning to the studio. They contributed a cover of John Lennon's \"Working Class Hero\" to the charity album Instant Karma, appeared in The Simpsons Movie, and recorded an entire album of '60s-styled rock & roll under the alias of Foxboro Hot Tubs. While presenting an award at the Grammys in early 2009, the band announced the impending release of their eighth album, 21st Century Breakdown, which had been recorded with veteran producer Butch Vig. In May 2009, 21st Century Breakdown was released, picking up where American Idiot left off as another ambitious punk rock opera. The album was a commercial success, selling over 215,000 copies in its first three days of sales. In 2009, American Idiot was adapted for the stage, and the following year, Green Day lent their talents to the original cast recording, combining a driving score with Broadway vocal arrangements. The band released the live Awesome as F**k in 2011.\r\nDuring the summer of 2012, Green Day unveiled their ambitious plans for the fall and winter: they would release not one but three new albums. The records -- ¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, ¡Tré! -- would appear in September 2012, November 2012, and January 2013, respectively, with each individual bandmember gracing one of the album covers on his own. The first, appropriately called ¡Uno!, was preceded by the disco-rock single \"Kill the DJ\" and the anthemic arena rocker \"Oh Love.\" ¡Uno! was set for a splashy release in September 2012, but the weekend prior to its release, Billie Joe Armstrong had an on-stage breakdown during a set Green Day played at the iHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas. Days later, it was announced that Armstrong entered rehab for substance abuse; not long afterward, the band's touring plans for 2013 were canceled. ¡Dos! arrived as scheduled in November 2012 and ¡Tré! was moved up to a December release. Demolicious, a collection of 18 demos recorded during the making of their ¡Uno! ¡Dos! ¡Tré! trilogy, showed up in time for 2014's Record Store Day release schedule.\r\nIn 2015, Green Day were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Following their induction, producer Rob Cavallo announced that he had started work on a new album with the trio. As they labored on the new record, Green Day released a single called \"Xmas Time of the Year\" for the 2015 holiday. The raucous \"Bang Bang\" was the first taste of their 12th record, Revolution Radio, which arrived in October 2016. The album topped the charts around the globe and featured the radio hit \"Still Breathing.\" A year later, the group released a career-spanning compilation called Greatest Hits: God's Favorite Band, which included the previously unreleased \"Back in the USA.\" Another retrospective release arrived in 2019, commemorating the band's 25th anniversary of playing Woodstock '94. Green Day Live!: Woodstock 1994 received a limited pressing for Record Store Day and debuted at number 156 on the Billboard 200.\r\nIn early 2020, the trio returned with their 13th studio album Father of All..., also known as \"Father of All Motherfuckers.\" Co-produced by Butch Walker, the album represented a different approach for the band, with a short running time of less than 30 minutes and songs that tended more toward glam, soul, and anthemic rock than Green Day's usual punk. The album debuted at number four upon its February 2020 release but plans to promote the album came to a halt with the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. During lockdown, Armstrong released the covers song compilation No Fun Mondays and started working on new material. The non-LP singles \"Here Comes the Shock,\" \"Pollyanna,\" and \"Holy Toledo!\" were issued during the Hella Mega Tour with Fall Out Boy and Weezer in 2021 and 2022. The group reunited with producer Rob Cavallo for the first time in a decade to record Saviors, a celebration of their pop-punk instincts that arrived in January 2024. It topped both the Rock and Alternative Albums charts and reached number four on the Billboard 200. That September, they marked the 20th anniversary of American Idiot with an expanded deluxe edition. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "Holding Absence is a post-hardcore quartet from Cardiff, Wales, that delivers pummeling percussion, striking guitar riffs, and huge choruses. Emerging in 2015, the band issued its eponymous debut long-player on Sharptone in 2019 and made its first U.K. chart appearance two years later with The Greatest Mistake of My Life. Personnel changes preceded the release of the band's third full-length effort, 2023's hard-hitting and inward-looking Noble Art of Self Destruction.\r\nFollowing an initial stint fronted by Zac Vernon -- late of Parting Gift -- and with Giorgio Cantarutti on rhythm guitar, by early 2017 they eventually settled on a lineup comprised of Lucas Woodland (vocals), Feisal El-Khazragi (guitar), James Joseph (bass), and Ashley Green (drums). That year saw them put out a number of singles including \"Penance\" and \"Heaven Knows\" and having earned a committed local fan base, the band went on to sign with Sharptone Records. In 2018, they released a split EP, This Is as One, with British metalcore act Loathe, with whom they toured Europe on their first dates outside the U.K. Following these shows, and part-way through the recording of their eponymous debut, El-Khazragi left to play bass for Loathe. A nomination for Best U.K. Breakthrough Band at the Heavy Metal Awards followed and, before the year was out, El-Khazragi had been replaced by two guitarists. Scott Carey joined on lead, while Chris Smitheram played rhythm for a short while. However, by early 2019 Carey had become the group's sole guitarist.\r\nWhen their first LP appeared in March 2019, it was a product of two different bouts of recording with two different lineups. Still, the singles \"Like a Shadow\" and \"Dream of Me\" boosted their profile, and the record garnered positive reviews. While the rest of 2019 was spent touring the continent again, 2020 was a productive year in the studio and saw them create what would ultimately become 2021's U.K.-charting The Greatest Mistake of My Life. However, before the record was released, Joseph departed to focus on a project with his housemate under the moniker, James & The Cold Gun, leaving a core trio of Woodland, Green, and Carey to promote it. Benjamin Elliott took over on bass before releasing The Lost & the Longing, a split EP with Alpha Wolf, and 2023's The Noble Art of Self Destruction. The band's third full-length effort, the dynamic and immersive LP focused on themes of struggle, forgiveness, and self-improvement. ~ Rob Wacey & James Wilkinson",

    summary: "Texas metalcore combo Invent Animate rose in the mid-2010s with an intricate, technically dazzling sound that incorporated djent, ambient, progressive metal, and post-hardcore. While enduring a handful of membership changes, they earned a reputation for detailed studio craft on albums like 2016's Stillworld and 2020's Greyview while also cementing a legacy as a fierce live act. After three albums on Tragic Hero, they signed with Australia's UNFD and released 2023's Heavener.\r\nInvent Animate formed in 2011 in the coastal Texas town of Port Neches. Singer Ben English, guitarists Logan Forrest and Keaton Goldwire, bassist Caleb Sherrada, and drummer Trey Celaya quickly harnessed their potent fusion of styles into an EP, Waves, which found favor within the djent community upon its 2012 release. The band soon signed with Tragic Hero Records and continued working with producer Brian Hood on a full-length debut. Released in August 2014, Everchanger was a bold, loosely conceptual set centered on the constant nature of change. It would be the only album to feature Invent Animate's original lineup, as guitarist Forrest departed later the following year. On their 2016 follow-up, Stillworld, drummer Celaya acted as studio guitarist while still drumming on the road. Through group continued to tour heavily over the next two years and in 2018, founding vocalist English was replaced by Swedish singer and former Aviana member Marcus Vik.\r\nVik made his debut on 2020's Greyview, the band's third and final record for Tragic Hero. As with each of their previous albums, an instrumental version was also released. Moving over to Australian imprint UNFD, Invent Animate offered the EP The Sun Sleeps, As If It Never Was, an intense three-song release exploring trauma and addiction. In 2022, founding drummer Celaya left to join fellow Texans Fit for a King. Satyr member Brody Taylor-Smith took over on drums for 2023's Heavener, Invent Animate's first full-length for UNFD. ~ Gregory Heaney & Timothy Monger",

    summary: "Bruised and bloodied, Knocked Loose open up the pit with a brutal sound that falls between hardcore punk and metalcore. The Kentucky-based group issued a pair of EPs before inking a deal with Pure Noise ahead of the release of their first full-length effort, 2016's uncompromising Laugh Tracks. The band continued to hone their beatdown hardcore sound on subsequent efforts like 2019's A Different Shade of Blue and 2024's You Won't Go Before You're Supposed To, both of which broke into the upper reaches of the Billboard charts.\r\nLed by screaming frontman Bryan Garris, the Oldham County, Kentucky quintet is also composed of guitarists Isaac Hale and Cole Crutchfield, bassist Kevin Otten, and drummer Dylan Isaacs. In 2011, Garris, Otten, and Hale joined drummer Jared Barron (Concealer, Greyhaven) for an early incarnation of the group (a teenaged Garris honed his early vocal skills by practicing in various area bands with Barron). Later, they enlisted Isaacs as their permanent drummer. Their first EP, Pop Culture, was released on Little Heart in 2014, quickly followed by a split EP with Louisville quintet Damaged Goods. Knocked Loose's debut LP arrived in 2016. Laugh Tracks (Pure Noise) debuted on the Billboard 200 and in the Top 50 on six separate side charts. The band teamed up with prolific engineer Will Putney for their sophomore effort, 2019's punishing A Different Shade of Blue, which introduced elements of thrash and melodic death metal into their already punitive sound.\r\nIn 2021, Knocked Loose released the potent Tear in the Fabric of Life, a conceptual six-song EP about grief and isolation that was accompanied by a short, animated film created by Swedish filmmaker Magnus Jonsson. 2023 saw the release of Upon Loss, a double-single comprised of \"Deep in the Willow\" and \"Everything Is Quiet Now,\" both of which were produced by Drew Fulks (aka WZRD BLD). In February 2024, the band announced that their forthcoming third long-player, You Won't Go Before You're Supposed To, would be released later that May. Working again with the Grammy-nominated pop producer, Knocked Loose explored every sonic facet of modern hardcore, delivering an inventive and relentless ten-song set with features from Poppy and Chris Motionless. The album debuted at the number 23 position on the U.S. Billboard 200 and charted throughout the world. ~ Neil Z. Yeung",

    summary: "Chicago's Knuckle Puck specialize in a muscular and melodic blend of old-school punk rock and emo. Following a series of buzzed-about EPs in the early 2010s, the band gained wider attention with their 2014 full-length Copacetic and its 2017 follow-up Shapeshifter. Knuckle Puck toured the U.S. and Europe heavily, playing with bands like Neck Deep, Good Charlotte, and Mayday Parade and releasing a third album, 20/20, in late 2020. After signing with the Pure Noise label, they returned in 2023 with a more intense tone on their fourth album Losing What We Love.\r\nHailing from the southernmost suburbs of the Windy City, pop-punk unit Knuckle Puck formed in 2010 around the talents of John Siorek (drums), Joe Taylor (vocals), Nick Casasanto (guitar/vocals), Ryan Rumchaks (bass), and Kevin Maida (guitar). Drawing well-earned comparisons to bands like the Wonder Years, the Story So Far, and Rise Against, the group put out a trio of self-released EPs (2011's Knuckle Puck Demo, 2012's Don't Come Home, and 2013's The Weight That You Buried) before inking a deal with Bad Timing Records, which issued two more EPs (While I Stay Secluded and Weight That You Buried) in 2014.\r\nAnother deal was struck, this time with Rise Records, and in the summer of 2015, Knuckle Puck finally released their debut album, Copacetic, which made a solid showing on the alternative and hard rock charts as well as Billboard's Top 200. Tours of the U.S. and Europe followed, and in March 2017 the band delivered a non-album 7\" single featuring a pair of tunes, \"Calendar Days\" and \"Indecisive.\" Knuckle Puck's sophomore album, Shapeshifter, arrived in October of that year, reaching number 50 on the Billboard pop chart.\r\nEschewing the more introspective style of their first two albums, the band sought a more overtly positive tone their next outing. Led by upbeat songs like \"RSVP\" and \"Breathe,\" 20/20 was released in September of its titular year and marked Knuckle Puck's last release for Rise. In December 2021, they released a single, \"Levitate,\" and went out on a headlining tour in celebration of their tenth anniversary. A self-released 2022 EP, Disposable Life, was followed by tours with Hot Mulligan and New Found Glory, after which they signed with Pure Noise and released the single \"Groundhog Day.\" Throughout 2023, Knuckle Puck delivered additional singles like \"The Tower\" and \"Losing What We Love.\" Less hopeful and more intense than their previous work, they paved the way for the group's fourth album, Losing What We Love, which came out later that year. ~ James Christopher Monger",

    summary: "Korn's cathartic sound positioned the group as one of the most popular and provocative acts to emerge during the 1990s. At the forefront of the nu-metal/rap-rock movement of the time, they quickly evolved, developing a trademark style that incorporated downtuned guitars, a groove-heavy rhythm section, haunted atmospheric production, and dark lyrics courtesy of frontman Jonathan Davis, who grappled with common themes such as childhood trauma, destructive behavior, and inner demons. (They even managed to make scatting and bagpipes -- Davis' signature instrument -- menacing.) Their landmark 1994 debut, Korn, built an underground audience for its follow-up, 1996's Life Is Peachy, which launched the band from the lower reaches of the charts into the Top Three. Just four years after emerging, they had a number one release: the blockbuster Follow the Leader, home to \"Freak on a Leash\" and \"Got the Life.\" Closing the decade atop the charts with Issues, Korn remained one of the biggest U.S. rock acts into the 2000s, issuing a string of platinum-certified albums: Untouchables (2002), Take a Look in the Mirror (2003), and See You on the Other Side (2005). After a few directional detours at the close of the 2000s, they made a turn into the electronic world, hiring dance acts including Skrillex to help produce the dubstep-blasted The Path of Totality in 2011. As the 2010s came to a close, Korn showed no signs of settling into a comfort zone; The Paradigm Shift, The Serenity of Suffering, and The Nothing all furthered their sonic development as they attained elder-statesmen status. The band approached their third decade together as a unit in 2022 with their 14th album, Requiem.\r\nThe group began their existence as the Bakersfield, California-based metal band LAPD, which included guitarists James \"Munky\" Shaffer and Brian \"Head\" Welch, bassist Reginald \"Fieldy\" Arvizu, and drummer David Silveria. After issuing an LP in 1993, the members of LAPD crossed paths with Jonathan Davis, a mortuary science student moonlighting as the lead vocalist for the local group Sexart. They soon asked Davis to join the band, and upon his arrival the quintet rechristened itself Korn. They recorded their demo, Neidermayer's Mind, in 1993 with producer Ross Robinson (Deftones, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot), who would go on to be one of the most sought-after rock producers of the late '90s and early aughts.\r\nAfter signing to Epic's Immortal imprint, they issued their debut self-titled album in late 1994. With a relentless tour schedule that included stints opening for Ozzy Osbourne, Megadeth, Marilyn Manson, and 311, the record slowly but steadily rose in the charts, eventually going gold on the back of hit single \"Blind.\" Combining dark lyrical content about child abuse, molestation, discrimination, and drug addiction with hip-hop influences and downtuned guitar sludge, Korn were unintentionally at the forefront of the movement that would be dubbed nu-metal. The band's 1996 Grammy-nominated follow-up, Life Is Peachy, was a more immediate smash, reaching the number three spot on the pop album charts. The album featured \"A.D.I.D.A.S.\" and a cover of Ice Cube's \"Wicked\" with Deftones frontman Chino Moreno.\r\nIn 1998, Korn released Follow the Leader, their biggest release to date. The album debuted atop the Billboard 200, spawning the hit singles \"Got the Life\" and \"Freak on a Leash.\" They won a Grammy for the \"Freak on a Leash\" video and, among the boy bands and pop starlets, conquered MTV's Total Request Live. That same year, the band kicked off the inaugural stint of their Family Values tour, featuring a lineup that consisted of friends and contemporaries Limp Bizkit, rapper Ice Cube, German industrial metal band Rammstein, and the first signees to Davis' imprint Elementree Records, Orgy. Follow the Leader eventually went quintuple platinum and sold over ten-million copies worldwide.\r\nAfter capping off their summer with a slot on the main stage of Woodstock '99, they began promotion for their fourth effort, Issues. Featuring the singles \"Falling Away from Me,\" \"Make Me Bad,\" and \"Somebody Someone,\" Issues continued Korn's dominance on MTV, rock radio, and the Billboard charts, debuting at number one. The band toured behind the album on the Sick & Twisted Tour with Staind, P.O.D., Papa Roach, and Powerman 5000. Even when Silveria was sidelined by a back injury, the band forged ahead with former Faith No More drummer Mike Bordin (Silveria later returned amid rumors of leaving the band for a fashion career, but these stemmed from some modeling work he had done before his injury.) An American stadium tour dubbed Summer Sanitarium followed later that year with Metallica, Kid Rock, Powerman 5000, and System of a Down also on the bill. Before the release of their next album, Fieldy released a gangsta rap album and Davis scored the film Queen of the Damned. At the end of 2001, the band reunited as a unit and entered the studio.\r\nJust as the band's popularity reached a dizzying high, they unveiled a new sound that featured more instrumental experimentation and more singing on Davis' part. The Grammy-winning Untouchables arrived in the summer of 2002, debuting at number two behind Eminem, and featured the singles \"Here to Stay\" and \"Thoughtless.\" Korn did a run of Ozzfest dates in support, and the album was another smash hit, selling over five-million copies worldwide.\r\nShortly after, the band released the self-produced Take a Look in the Mirror in 2003. Touted by Korn as a reconsideration of their sound (they even included a reworking of Neidermayer demo track \"Alive\"), the album was accompanied by the Back to Basics tour, which saw the band playing smaller venues with old friends Limp Bizkit. Despite the album going multi-platinum, this era would mark the start of the band's decline in mainstream popularity, a period made even worse by the departure of founding guitarist Welch, who left the band in 2005 after converting to Christianity.\r\nKorn forged forth, playing shows that summer as a quartet and signing an expansive recording and development deal with Virgin. The following December they released See You on the Other Side, a number three hit that featured a batch of hook-ready songs co-written with hitmaking pop production team the Matrix (Avril Lavigne, Britney Spears). Other Side would be the band's final work with their founding drummer Silveria, who left the band in 2006. Live & Rare was released that same year, with the live acoustic recording MTV Unplugged -- featuring Robert Smith of the Cure and Amy Lee of Evanescence -- following in March 2007. Later that year, the band resurfaced with an underwhelming album that was purposely left untitled (sometimes referred to as Korn II). Without Silveria, the band enlisted guest drummers to contribute in the studio, including Terry Bozzio (Frank Zappa), Brooks Wackerman (Bad Religion), and even Jonathan Davis himself. The band eventually found a permanent replacement by way of Army of Anyone's Ray Luzier. In 2010, Korn signed with Roadrunner Records and brought Ross Robinson back to the fold. Their ninth album, Korn III: Remember Who You Are, was both a return to form and safe retread, signaling the revitalization of the band.\r\nLooking to expand in risky new directions, Korn sought out electronic producers like Skrillex and Noisia, who helped them infuse their already heavy sound with pounding dubstep on their electronic-tinged tenth album, 2011's The Path of Totality. The effort debuted atop the Billboard Dance/Electronic chart and was their 11th LP to arrive in the Top Ten of the Billboard 200. Their new sound was chronicled live the following year on Live at the Hollywood Palladium.\r\nIn May 2012, prodigal guitarist Welch guested with the band on a version of \"Blind\" at a show in North Carolina. Exactly a year later, he announced that he had officially rejoined the band. With the (almost) original lineup back together, Korn set to work on their 11th album. The Paradigm Shift, Welch's first album with Korn in a decade, appeared in October of 2013. Inspired by the melodic brutality of Issues and Untouchables, The Paradigm Shift debuted in the Top Ten on the American, German, Austrian, and Australian charts. For the 20th anniversary of their seminal debut, Korn embarked on a tour playing Korn in its entirety.\r\nIn 2015, the band returned to the studio to record their 12th LP. The Serenity of Suffering was released in late 2016. It featured the lead single \"Rotting in Vain\" and a guest appearance by Slipknot vocalist Corey Taylor on \"A Different World.\" The set peaked at number four on the Billboard 200, their highest showing since 2010. In the midst of a global tour, they began recording their 13th album, The Nothing, with returning producer Nick Raskulinecz. Heavily influenced by the 2018 death of Davis' wife, the emotionally intense set included the singles \"You'll Never Find Me\" and \"Cold.\" Although the COVID-19 pandemic halted any touring in support of the Top Ten release, the band issued a fiery Yelawolf-assisted cover of Charlie Daniels' \"Devil Went Down to Georgia\" in the summer of 2020.\r\nThe next year, tour promotion of The Nothing kicked off with one-time tourmates Staind. Arvizu took a break from the band for personal reasons, with Suicidal Tendencies' Ra Diaz picking up bass duties. A month after the trek concluded, Korn were already prepared for another cycle, releasing the single \"Start the Healing\" from their 2022 effort, Requiem. Recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic without a deadline or label pressure, the lean nine-track set continued the band's focus on emotional growth and maturity while tapping into common Korn themes of loss and catharsis. On the eve of the album's release, the band performed an intimate show at the Hollywood United Methodist Church dubbed the Requiem Mass, inviting audience members to bring a small token of remembrance to honor a loved one who had passed away. A live recording of the non-acoustic portion of that set was released in 2023 as part of a limited-edition deluxe Requiem package. ~ Neil Z. Yeung",

    summary: "Kublai Khan are a metalcore quartet from North Texas with an aggressive, punishing sound that combines monstrous riffs and thrashing blastbeats with thoughtful lyrics that address issues such as racism, depression, and addiction. Not to be confused with the '80s speed metal band of the same name, Kublai Khan issued their punishing debut full-length, Balancing Survival and Happiness, in 2014. The band inked a deal with Rise Records ahead of the release of 2017's Nomad, and continued to explore hardcore sub-genres on subsequent efforts Absolute (2019), Lowest Form of Animal (2022), and Exhibition of Prowess (2024).\r\nThe group consists of guitarist/vocalist Nolan Ashley, vocalist/lyricist Matt Honeycutt, bassist Eric English, and drummer Isaac Lamb. After forming in 2009, they self-released their debut EP, Youth War, in January of 2011. The group built up a fan base through solid regional and national touring, and eventually opened for bands such as the Acacia Strain, Fit for a King, and Texas in July. The group signed to Artery Recordings in early 2014, releasing their debut full-length, Balancing Survival and Happiness, that spring. Kublai Khan toured Europe with Obey the Brave in the spring of 2014, and appeared at the Impericon Festival in Germany. The group's second album, New Strength, appeared on Artery the following year. In 2017, the band signed with Rise Records and issued their third studio long-player, Nomad. Now operating under the more region-specific moniker Kublai Khan TX, the band continued to push against the sonic boundaries of metalcore on 2019's Absolute and 2022's Lowest Form of Animal EP, both of which added elements of electronicore and alternative metal to their uncompromising sound. On their fifth studio long-player, 2024's crushing Exhibition of Prowess, Kublai Khan delivered a potent set of songs rooted in classic, unrelenting hardcore, including the anthemic \"Darwinism,\" the deep groove-laden \"Theory of Mind,\" and the Jamey Jasta-featuring \"Hopeless Fate.\" ~ Paul Simpson",

    summary: "Formed in 1992 as a power pop trio with heavy punk leanings, Less Than Jake steadily transformed into a ska-inspired punk band with a keen sense of humor and a fixation on Pez candy. They hit their commercial zenith in 2003 with their fifth studio effort, Anthem, which spent 12 weeks on the Billboard 200. In 2008 they started their own label, Sleep It Off Records, with which they would go on to issue a string of full-lengths and EPs before saddling up with Fat Wreck Chords for 2013's Billboard-charting See the Light. Continuing to ride the third wave ska revival they helped to create, the band unleashed their eighth long-player, Silver Linings, in 2020.\r\nVocalist/guitarist Chris Demakes, bassist Shaun, and drummer/lyricist Vinnie Fiorello formed the first incarnation of the group, which took root in Gainesville, Florida. After Shaun became the group's roadie, however, he was replaced by bassist Roger Manganelli, who picked up the instrument just to join the band. In 1993 and 1994, the group added its first horn player, Jessica Mills, and soon after came trombone player Buddy Schaub. Right before their first tour, however, Schaub went to Europe with friends, so saxophonist Derron Nuhfer filled in for shows during his absence.\r\nWith various 7\" releases under their belt, Less Than Jake debuted in 1994 with the album Pezcore, on Dill Records. Losers, Kings & Things We Don't Understand and Greased followed on No Idea, and the group signed with Capitol for its major-label debut, 1996's Losing Streak. The album was full of the band's wry, fast-paced brand of ska-punk anthems, producing such fan favorites as \"Johnny Quest Thinks We're Sellouts\" and \"Jen Doesn't Like Me Anymore.\" Upon the album's completion, Jessica left to pursue teaching, and ex-Slapstick trombonist Pete came on board. Around this time, Fiorello also started his own record label, Fueled by Ramen, with friend John Janick. Hello Rockview followed in 1998, and spawned a minor college radio hit with \"History of a Boring Town.\" In fall 2000, the band released Borders & Boundaries on Fat Wreck, as well as landing the opening spot on Bon Jovi's North American tour.\r\nNuhfer left the band after the album's recording (and later went on to join Gunmoll), and Less Than Jake found his replacement in ex-Spring Heel Jack horn player Pete Wasilewski -- though to avoid any name confusion within the band, the second Pete was dubbed JR, and remained JR even after the first Pete decided to leave soon after the 2001 Warped Tour. Over the years, Less Than Jake issued more 7\" and limited-edition vinyl releases than most people can keep track of, so the bandmembers compiled some of their favorite tracks on one record for 2002's Goodbye Blue and White, named in honor of their original tour van. Anthem followed in 2003 on Sire; B Is for B-Sides was issued a year later, comprised of tracks that didn't make it to Anthem's final cut. The DVD retrospective People's History of Less Than Jake appeared a month later. The four-song EP Absolution for Idiots and Addicts was released in April 2006, with their next full-length, In with the Out Crowd, following a month later. The latter album's slicker, more pop-oriented nature received mixed reactions from fans. In 2007, Less Than Jake announced that they had left Warner Bros.; a year later, the group formed the Sleep It Off label and released GNV FLA, an album loosely based on (and dedicated to) their hometown. Their ninth album, See the Light, arrived in the fall of 2013. Their fondness for the EP format saw them release the seven-track Sound the Alarm in 2017, which marked their debut for Pure Noise Records. Three years later, they returned with their eighth full-length effort, Silver Linings. ~ John Bush & James Christopher Monger",

    summary: "Rooted at the crossroads of aggressive metal and beat-driven hip-hop, Linkin Park became one of the most successful acts of the early 21st century by incorporating elements from across genres, injecting hardcore rap, raucous punk, atmospheric electronic, and even polished pop stylings into their music. Despite being burdened with the oft-derided nu-metal and rap-rock genre designations, they soon evolved beyond those associations into a more complex beast. Indeed, as their original band name and debut album title suggested, they were a hybrid of forces, relying as much on the vocal interplay between singer Chester Bennington and rapper Mike Shinoda as on the band's muscled instrumentation, which layered DJ Hahn's effects atop heavy, processed guitars and pounding percussion. No matter their direction, pain and catharsis remained at their core. From the commercial peak of their hip-hop-influenced, multi-platinum breakthrough albums Hybrid Theory (2000) and Meteora (2003), into a brief electronic phase (2010's A Thousand Suns), and even to what might have been their final pop moment (2017's One More Light), they stayed ahead of the curve without sacrificing heaviness or chart success. Months after the release of their seventh and final album as the founding lineup, frontman Chester Bennington passed away, closing the book on a nearly two-decade first chapter that included five chart-topping albums and tens of millions of records sold across the globe. In 2024, the group reformed and introduced a new singer (Emily Armstrong) and drummer (Colin Brittain), launching a world tour and releasing their eighth album, From Zero.\r\nDrummer Rob Bourdon, guitarist Brad Delson, and MC/vocalist Mike Shinoda attended high school in Southern California, where they formed the rap-rock band Xero in 1996. Bassist Dave \"Phoenix\" Farrell, singer Mark Wakefield, and DJ/art student Joseph Hahn joined soon after, and the band courted various labels while playing hometown shows in Los Angeles. Few companies expressed interest in Xero's self-titled demo tape, however, prompting Wakefield to leave the lineup (he would later resurface as the manager for Taproot). When replacement singer Chester Bennington climbed aboard in 1998 -- sharing vocal duties with Shinoda in what would become a crucial part of their signature sound -- they rebranded as Hybrid Theory and issued an eponymous EP. Still struggling to find an audience, they finally caught the attention of Warner Bros. and chose a new name: Linkin Park, a misspelled reference to Lincoln Park in Santa Monica. With support from Warner Bros. vice-president Jeff Blue, the band entered the studio with Don Gilmore shortly thereafter to record what would become a diamond-certified worldwide smash.\r\nLinkin Park titled their debut album Hybrid Theory, a tribute to the band's past, and released the record during the fall of 2000. \"Crawling\" and \"In the End\" were massive radio hits; the latter song even topped the U.S. Modern Rock chart while peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, an example of the group's crossover appeal. Linkin Park joined the Family Values Tour and played shows with Cypress Hill, leading the band to log over 320 shows in 2001 alone. Come January 2002, Hybrid Theory had received three Grammy nominations and sold over seven million copies. (Sales later topped ten million, earning the album \"diamond status\" and making Hybrid Theory one of the most successful debuts ever.) Despite their meteoric rise, however, Linkin Park spent the remainder of the year holed up in the recording studio, again working with producer Don Gilmore on a follow-up album. Meanwhile, the timely summer release of the platinum Reanimation helped appease the band's eager audience, offering remixed versions of Hybrid Theory's tracks by famous faces from bands such as Korn, Deftones, Orgy, Jurassic 5, the Roots, Taproot, Marilyn Manson, Staind, and Dilated Peoples.\r\nFacing overwhelming expectations, Linkin Park's official sophomore effort, Meteora, arrived in March 2003. The chart-topping record spawned several modern rock hits, including \"Numb,\" \"Somewhere I Belong,\" and \"Breaking the Habit,\" which furthered the band's crossover appeal by simultaneously charting on the Hot 100. The group once again supported the album with ample touring, including performances with the second annual Projekt Revolution Tour (the band's own traveling festival, which originally launched in 2002) and additional shows with the likes of Metallica and Limp Bizkit. Live in Texas was released to document the group's strength as a touring act, and the bandmates tackled various personal projects before beginning work on a second remix project.\r\nReleased in 2004, Collision Course found the band collaborating with rapper Jay-Z, resulting in a number of mashups that sampled from both artists' catalogs. Collision Course topped the charts upon its release, the first EP to do so since Alice in Chains' Jar of Flies, and Jay-Z furthered his association with the band by asking co-founder Mike Shinoda to explore the possibility of a solo hip-hop project. He did, dubbing the project Fort Minor and releasing The Rising Tied in 2005 with Jay-Z as executive producer. Linkin Park then reconvened in 2006 to begin work on a third studio album, which saw Shinoda sharing production credits with Rick Rubin. The resulting Minutes to Midnight, a more traditional rock affair that largely left behind their trademark hip-hop heart, arrived in 2007, debuting at number one in several countries and spawning the Top Ten single \"What I've Done.\" In between albums, the group contributed the theme to Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, \"New Divide,\" which became one of their most enduring hits.\r\nIn 2010, Linkin Park returned to the studio with Rubin to produce their fourth studio album. Veering off-course once again, A Thousand Suns was a left-field experimental project based largely in ambient electronica, which divided their fans. Nevertheless, singles \"The Catalyst\" and \"Waiting for the End\" were both chart-topping hits. The following year, Bennington stated the band's desire to focus more on putting out new material rather than maintaining an exhaustive touring schedule, with the group having a goal of releasing a new album every 18 months. Linkin Park made good on that promise in 2012 with their Rick Rubin-produced fifth LP, Living Things, which saw something of a return to their hybrid sound of yore. Upon its June release, the album debuted at the top of the Billboard charts, selling over 223,000 copies in its first week. It would soon be certified gold, and the singles \"Burn It Down,\" \"Lost in the Echo,\" and \"Castle of Glass\" maintained the band's presence on international singles charts.\r\nAs Linkin Park began work on their sixth studio album in the spring of 2013, Bennington announced that he was replacing Scott Weiland as the lead vocalist of Stone Temple Pilots; he was not leaving Linkin Park, but instead planned to be in both groups simultaneously. Bennington underscored his commitment to both bands in October 2013 by releasing his debut EP with STP, High Rise, and appearing with Linkin Park on the remix album Recharged that same month. The latter album's lead single, \"A Light That Never Comes,\" recorded in collaboration with DJ Steve Aoki, was a worldwide club hit. Another Aoki collaboration, \"Darker Than Blood,\" was featured on the DJ's Neon Future II and entered the Top 50 on both Billboard dance and electronic charts.\r\nIn June 2014, Linkin Park unveiled The Hunting Party, their sixth effort. The album -- produced by the bandmembers themselves -- was inspired by the punk, metal, and hardcore they had listened to as teens. The resulting collection was loud, raw, and heavy, featuring guest appearances by Tom Morello, System of a Down's Daron Malakian, Helmet's Page Hamilton, and hip-hop legend Rakim. Although it was kept out of the top spot on the U.S. charts, it hit number one in half-a-dozen countries around the world, and became one of the year's biggest sellers in hard rock circles.\r\nAfter promotion for The Hunting Party concluded, the band returned to the drawing board for a follow-up. When Linkin Park emerged from the studio in 2017, they were accompanied by a drastic shift in their sound that proved to be divisive. Lead single \"Heavy,\" a duet featuring singer Kiiara and production by pop songwriters Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter, was a taste of things to come on the band's seventh effort, One More Light. Despite the clear pop trajectory, it became their fifth number one album and was soon certified gold. Barely two months after its release and one week before beginning a major American tour, Bennington was found dead at his home in Southern California; he was 41.\r\nOn October 27, 2017, months after Bennington's tragic passing, the group hosted a tribute concert for their late singer, Linkin Park and Friends: Celebrate Life in Honor of Chester Bennington. An all-star roster of friends joined the band at the Hollywood Bowl, including members of blink-182, Korn, Avenged Sevenfold, Yellowcard, Bring Me the Horizon, System of a Down, No Doubt, Orgy, One OK Rock, Bush, and Sum 41, as well as Zedd, Machine Gun Kelly, Alanis Morissette, and Steve Aoki. They closed the era with a release compiling Bennington's final performances with the band, One More Light: Live.\r\nFollowing Bennington's death, Linkin Park went on indefinite hiatus, although they continued working on a number of archival projects. In late 2020, they celebrated the 20th anniversary of their breakthrough with a set that bundled Hybrid Theory with bonuses that included live recordings and rarities. Featured on the album was the song \"She Couldn't,\" which was recorded in 1999 but never officially released. A remix of the group's debut single, \"One Step Closer,\" by electronic duo 100 gecs appeared in January 2021. The next retrospective collection arrived in 2023 to celebrate the Meteora era. In similar fashion, this hulking box set included the original album, live concerts from Texas and Nottingham, a slew of rarities and demos, and more. Additionally, Meteora20 included a handful of previously unreleased songs, including \"Fighting Myself\" and \"Lost,\" the latter of which returned the band to the international Top Ten and topped charts in Canada, the U.K., and U.S. Those tracks later received a dedicated release in the form of Lost Demos, which was released in November 2023 and edged its way onto the Billboard 200.\r\nIn early 2024, more tracks from the vault materialized, the first being \"Friendly Fire\" from the One More Light sessions. That song, along with fan-favorite \"QWERTY,\" was packed with over a dozen other highlights for the career-spanning compilation Papercuts (Singles Collection 2000-2023), which arrived in April. Months later, speculation and rumors about a re-formed band with a female lead singer were finally confirmed with the September reveal of a reunited band, tour, and album. Debuting at a top secret gig as Shinoda's co-vocalist, Emily Armstrong (Dead Sara) joined the lineup alongside drummer/producer Colin Brittain, who replaced founding member Rob Bourdon. In the flurry of activity, the revamped Linkin Park released the single \"The Emptiness Machine\" and announced a brief international tour and their eighth album, From Zero. ~ Neil Z. Yeung",

    summary: "A U.K. rock institution, Manic Street Preachers emerged at the dawn of the 1990s as a fiery rebuke of the placid state of British indie rock, a scene that grew to favor the swirling solipsism of shoegaze and the neo-psychedelia of acid house. Inspired by the provocative punk of the Clash and the heavy glam of Guns N' Roses, the Manics wedded leftist politics with arena-filling guitar riffs, a combination that made them irresistible to the British rock press of the '90s. The group's rise ran parallel to the ascendency of Brit-pop but just when they were at the cusp of stardom, lyricist/guitarist Richey James disappeared after the release of their early masterwork The Holy Bible. The trio of James Dean Bradfield, Nicky Wire, and Sean Moore regrouped to deliver Everything Must Go, a 1996 album where they unveiled a subdued, mature sound that suited a set of songs where they came to terms with their loss. Everything Must Go eclipsed the group's three previous albums, a success consolidated by its 1998 sequel, This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours, the pair of records that established them as one of the U.K.'s leading rock acts. From that point forward, Manic Street Preachers adhered to the template established in the late '90s -- big music delivered passionately -- while also refusing to abandon the political principles they established at the start of their career. The combination helped the Manics retain a fervent following: in 2021, The Ultra Vivid Lament became their first album in 23 years to top the U.K. charts. They followed this success with a pair of vibrant 2024 singles, kicking off the album cycle for 2025's Critical Thinking, their 15th full-length.\r\nJames Dean Bradfield (vocals, guitar), Nicky Wire (born Nick Jones; bass), Sean Moore (drums), and Flicker (rhythm guitar) formed Betty Blue in 1986. Within two years' time, Flicker had left the band and the group had changed its name to the Manic Street Preachers. In the summer of 1988, a fellow student at Swansea University, Richey James (born Richey Edwards), who had previously been the group's driver, joined the band as rhythm guitarist. They began recording demos, eventually releasing the single \"Suicide Alley\" in August. \"Suicide Alley\" boasted a cover replicating that of the Clash's first album, which indicated the sound of the group at the time -- equal parts punk and hard rock. A year after the single's release, NME gave it an enthusiastic review, citing James' press release -- \"We are as far away from anything in the '80s as possible.\"\r\nIndeed, the Manics were one of the key bands of the early '90s, and their career didn't get rolling until 1991. The New Art Riot EP appeared in the summer of 1990, followed by a pair of defining singles -- \"Motown Junk\" and \"You Love Us\" -- in early 1991 on Heavenly Records. The singles and the Manics' incendiary live shows, where they wrote slogans on their shirts, created a strong buzz in the music press, which only escalated that May. James gave an interview with Steve Lamacq for NME in which Lamacq questioned the group's authenticity; after an argument, James responded by carving the words \"4 Real\" on his arm. The incident became a sensation, attracting numerous magazine articles, as well as a major-label contract with Sony. Many observers interpreted the action as a simple stunt, but over the next few years it became clear that the self-mutilation was the first indication of James' mental instability.\r\n\"Stay Beautiful\" was the Manics' first release for Sony, and it climbed into the British Top 40 late in the summer of 1991, followed early in 1992 by a re-recorded \"You Love Us,\" which peaked in the Top 20. By the time they released their much-hyped debut album, Generation Terrorists, in February 1992 -- a record the band claimed would outsell Guns N' Roses' Appetite for Destruction -- they had already cultivated a large and devoted following, many of whom emulated their glammy appearance and read the same novels and philosophers the group name-dropped. The Manics had been claiming that they would disband following the release of their debut, yet it became clear by the fall, when a non-LP cover of \"Suicide Is Painless (Theme from MAS*H)\" became their first Top Ten hit, that they would continue performing. Nicky Wire and Richey James had become notorious for their banter throughout the British music press, and while it earned them countless articles, it also painted the group into a corner. Comparatively polished and mainstream compared to its predecessor, Gold Against the Soul, the group's second album, appeared in the summer of 1993 to mixed reviews.\r\nShortly after the release of Gold Against the Soul, the Manics' support began to slide as the group began to splinter amidst internal tensions, many of them stemming from James. Nicky Wire ran into trouble over on-stage remarks about R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe dying of AIDS, but Richey James was in genuine trouble. Suffering from deepening alcoholism and anorexia, James entered prolonged bouts of depression, highlighted by incidents of self-mutilation -- most notoriously at a concert in Thailand, when he appeared with his chest slashed open by knives a fan gave him. Early in 1994, he entered a private clinic, and the band had to perform a number of concerts as a trio. James' mental illness surfaced on the group's third album, The Holy Bible. Reportedly recorded in a red-light district in Wales, The Holy Bible was a bleak, disillusioned record that earned considerable critical acclaim upon its late summer release in 1994.\r\nAlthough the Manics' critical reputation was restored and James was playing with the band, even giving numerous interviews with the press, all was not well. Prior to the American release of The Holy Bible and the band's ensuing tour, James checked out of his London hotel on February 1, 1995, drove to his Cardiff apartment, and disappeared, leaving behind his passport and credit cards. Within a week he was reported missing and his abandoned car was found on the Severn Bridge outside of Bristol, a spot notorious for suicides. By the summer, the police had presumed he was dead. Broken but not beaten, the remaining Manics decided to carry on as a trio, working the remaining lyrics James left behind into songs.\r\nThe Manic Street Preachers returned in December 1995 opening for the Stone Roses. In May 1996, they released Everything Must Go, which was preceded by the number two single \"A Design for Life.\" Their most direct and mature record to date, Everything Must Go was greeted with enthusiastic reviews, and the Manics became major stars in England. Throughout 1996, the band toured constantly, and most U.K. music publications named Everything Must Go Album of the Year. Despite their growing success, several older fans expressed distress at the group's increasingly conservative image, yet that didn't prevent the album from going multi-platinum.\r\nEverything Must Go didn't just go multi-platinum -- it established the Manics as superstars throughout the world. Everywhere except America, that is. The record received a belated release in the U.S., appearing in August of 1996, and the group attempted an American tour opening for Oasis. It should have led to increased exposure, but a blowup between the Gallaghers led to Oasis canceling the entire tour, leaving the Manics at square one. They returned to the U.K. and toured, receiving a number of awards at the end of the year. They didn't deliver their much-anticipated follow-up, This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours, until August of 1998. The album was another blockbuster success in the U.K., Europe, and Asia, but it didn't receive a release in America, since the Manics were in the process of leaving Epic in the U.S.\r\nFor a while, there was simply no interest in the Manics from American labels, but another multi-platinum album and numerous awards in Britain revived press attention. The band signed with Virgin, which issued This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours in the U.S. in June 1999 -- nearly a year after its initial release. Know Your Enemy followed in 2001, although it was not well-received, and the band moved to Sony for British distribution of 2004's Lifeblood. Both vocalist/guitarist James Dean Bradfield and bassist Nicky Wire followed this release with solo albums, and then reconvened in 2007 to record the edgier, punk-influenced Send Away the Tigers with producer Dave Eringa. After its release, the band quickly set to work on another album, using Richey James' abandoned lyrics as inspiration. \"All 13 songs on the new record feature lyrics left to us by Richey,\" the Manics wrote on their website in early 2009. \"The brilliance and intelligence of the lyrics dictated that we had to finally use them.\" Titled Journal for Plague Lovers, the album was recorded on analog tape by veteran engineer Steve Albini and released that May. Going for a more robust and commercial sound, they rehired former producer Dave Eringa to make 2010's Postcards from a Young Man, which featured guest appearances from John Cale and Ian McCulloch.\r\nAfter releasing a compilation called National Treasures: The Complete Singles in the fall of 2011, the Manics released a super-deluxe 20th Anniversary edition of Generation Terrorists in 2012. Meanwhile, they plugged away in the studio, working on a ludicrously ambitious project tentatively titled 70 Songs of Hatred and Failure. At one point they despaired of simply having written too much material before hitting on the idea of releasing two very different albums. The first, a folky, almost entirely acoustic, emotionally raw effort titled Rewind the Film, appeared in the fall of 2013, and the second, the spiky and Krautrock-inspired Futurology, was issued in May 2014.\r\nA documentary on the Manics, Escape from History, arrived in 2017, followed by the full-length Resistance Is Futile in April 2018.\r\nIn 2020, Bradfield's second solo effort, Even in Exile -- a concept album about the Chilean activist Victor Jara -- went to the U.K. Top Ten. The following year, the Manics returned with their 14th studio album, The Ultra Vivid Lament, a record largely written by Bradfield on piano. Preceded by the single \"Orwellian,\" The Ultra Vivid Lament became Manic Street Preachers' first number one album in the U.K. since This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours in 1998. The Manics would support the album with a co-headlining North American tour with Suede, marking the first time either band toured the continent in a number of years. As the band began to work on its follow-up, they celebrated their earlier catalog by remastering 2001's Know Your Enemy and issuing one of its unreleased outtakes, \"Rosebud,\" as a single. 2024 started with the 20th anniversary reissue of Lifeblood, setting the table for a pair of new songs, \"Hiding in Plain Sight\" and \"Decline & Fall,\" in October. These were revealed to be the lead singles from the Manics' 15th studio album, Critical Thinking, scheduled for release in early 2025.  ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "Metallica is the definitive heavy metal band, the group that brought the gnarly underground sounds of thrash metal into the mainstream, then reshaped the contours of heavy music and hard rock once they became the biggest rock band in the world after the release of their self-titled \"black album\" in 1991. By that point, Metallica already had experienced enough upheaval for two careers. Emerging from the feverish metal underground of the early '80s, Metallica became a word-of-mouth sensation with their indie releases Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning, records that helped them land a contract with Elektra. Master of Puppets, their major-label debut, found the band marshaling their forces, but months after its release, the group suffered a tragic bus accident that killed bassist Cliff Burton. Vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield, drummer Lars Ulrich, and guitarist Kirk Hammett forged ahead with Jason Newsted, who appeared on 1988's …And Justice for All, their first album to reach the Billboard Top Ten. Once Metallica turned the band into superstars in the early '90s, the group sustained their popularity as they explored new territory, streamlining their sound for Load and Re-Load, then recording the orchestral collaboration S&M with the San Francisco Symphony. Despite their success, Metallica still had inner troubles, many of which they aired on Some Kind of Monster, a documentary about the recording of St. Anger, their first album without Newsted. With bassist Robert Trujillo coming aboard in 2003, Metallica eventually reconnected with the spirit of speed metal on 2008's Death Magnetic, then discovered ways to mature metal on 2016's Hardwired…To Self-Destruct and 2023's 72 Seasons.\r\nMetallica was formed in Los Angeles in 1981 by drummer Lars Ulrich. He put a call out for local musicians to form a new band, and eventually an early lineup came together that included guitarist/vocalist James Hetfield, bassist Ron McGovney, and lead guitarist Dave Mustaine. In their earliest iteration, Metallica combined the speedy tempos of hardcore punk acts like Discharge with the influence of more obscure acts from the New Wave of British Heavy Metal that was unfolding around the same time, resulting in some of the earliest thrash metal. The band made a few demo recordings with McGovney before asking him to leave the group when they met innovative bassist Cliff Burton. Burton eventually joined Metallica, and the quartet set out to record their first album in 1983. During the recording sessions, however, Mustaine's problems with drugs and alcohol led to him being fired from the band, and they quickly recruited new lead guitarist Kirk Hammett to complete the album. Released in 1983 on independent thrash-focused label Megaforce Records, Metallica's debut long-player, Kill 'Em All, marked the beginning of the legitimization of heavy metal's underground, bringing new complexity and depth to thrash metal. Second album Ride the Lightning followed quickly in 1984, deepening the band's sound with the inclusion of classically themed guitar elements and the dark ballad \"Fade to Black.\"\r\nShortly after the release of Ride the Lightning, Metallica signed on with major-label Elektra Records. They worked with the label toward the release of their third LP, Master of Puppets, which came out in March 1986. The album would prove to be a significant breakthrough for Metallica, reaching mainstream audiences without diminishing the band's standing in the metal community. It was their best-selling record up until that point, but also their most innovative and boundary-pushing, going on to be heralded as one of the most influential metal albums of all time. Tragedy struck the group later that year when their tour bus crashed while traveling in Sweden. Burton died in the accident. When the band decided to continue, Flotsam and Jetsom bassist Jason Newsted was chosen to replace Burton. Newsted was touring with the band by 1987, and that year his first recorded material with Metallica was released on The $5.98 E.P. - Garage Days Re-Revisited, a self-produced EP of ragged covers the band put together in a practice space. In 1987, Metallica also paid tribute to their departed bassist with Cliff 'Em All, a video release that included unreleased live footage and intimate home videos of Burton.\r\nIn 1988, the band returned with their conceptually ambitious fourth studio album, ...And Justice for All. Before this record, Metallica had been outspoken about rejecting aspects of the music industry that they found disingenuous, including pandering for mainstream acceptance by making their music more accessible or making music videos, which were a relatively new medium in the 1980s. This changed with Justice, as the group released their first-ever video for the song \"One.\" Despite minimal support from MTV or mainstream radio, the album hit the Top Ten and sold over a million copies within weeks of its release. But the band completely crossed over into the mainstream with 1991's Metallica, a self-titled effort that found the group trading in their long compositions for more concise song structures. With slick, layered production from Bob Rock and a shift from the thrash of the band's early days for more digestible, almost pop-leaning hard rock hits like \"Wherever I May Roam\" and \"Enter Sandman,\" it resulted in a number one album that sold over seven million copies in the U.S. alone. To support the record, Metallica launched a long tour that kept the musicians on the road for nearly two years.\r\nBy the '90s, Metallica had changed the rules for all heavy metal bands; they were the leaders of the genre, respected not only by headbangers but by mainstream record buyers and critics. No other heavy metal band has ever been able to pull off such a feat. However, the group lost a portion of their core audience with their long-awaited follow-up to Metallica, 1996's Load. The album moved the band toward alternative rock in terms of image -- the bandmembers cut their hair and had their picture taken by Anton Corbijn. Although the record was a hit upon its summer release, entering the charts at number one and selling three million copies within two months, certain members of the Metallica fan base complained about the shift in image, as well as the group's decision to headline the sixth Lollapalooza. Re-Load, which combined new material with songs left off the original Load record, appeared in 1997; despite poor reviews, it sold at a typically brisk pace and spun off several successful singles, including \"Fuel\" and \"The Memory Remains.\" Garage Inc., a double-disc collection of B-sides, rarities, and newly recorded covers, followed in 1998. Metallica's take on Bob Seger's \"Turn the Page\" helped maintain their presence in the charts, and the band continued their flood of product with 1999's S&M, which documented a live concert with the San Francisco Symphony. It debuted at number two, reconfirming the group's immense popularity.\r\nMetallica spent most of 2000 embroiled in controversy by spearheading a legal assault against Napster, a file-sharing service that allowed users to download music files from each other's computers. Aggressively targeting copyright infringement of their own material, Metallica notoriously had over 300,000 users kicked off the service, creating a widespread debate over the availability of digital music that raged for most of the year. In January 2001, bassist Jason Newsted announced his amicable departure from the band. Shortly after the group appeared at the ESPN Awards in April of the same year, Hetfield, Hammett, and Ulrich entered the recording studio to begin work on their next album, with producer Bob Rock lined up to handle bass duties for the sessions (meanwhile, rumors swirled of former Ozzy Osbourne/Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez being considered for the vacated position). In July, Metallica surprisingly dropped their lawsuit against Napster, perhaps sensing that their controversial stance did more harm than good to their \"band of the people\" image. That same summer, the group's recording sessions (and all other band-related matters) were put on hold as Hetfield entered an undisclosed rehab facility for alcoholism and other addictions. He completed treatment and rejoined Metallica as they headed back into the studio in 2002 to record St. Anger, which was released in mid-2003.\r\nThe recording of St. Anger was capped with the search for a permanent replacement for Newsted. After a long audition process, former Ozzy Osbourne/Suicidal Tendencies bass player Robert Trujillo was selected and joined Metallica for their 2003-2004 world tour. The growing pains that the band experienced during the recording of St. Anger were captured in the celebrated documentary Some Kind of Monster, which saw theatrical release in 2004. Four years later, Metallica returned with Death Magnetic, an energized album that returned the group to their early-'80s roots. Former Slayer producer Rick Rubin helmed the album, having replaced the band's longtime producer Bob Rock, while Kirk Hammett (who was forbidden to play guitar solos on St. Anger) peppered the record with metallic riffs and frenetic solos.\r\nDeath Magnetic spent three weeks at number one on the Billboard charts and the band supported it with an extensive international tour that included a festival gig with Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax. Metallica closed out their Warner contract with Death Magnetic -- outtakes from the sessions appeared as the Beyond Magnetic EP in late 2011 -- and while they were exploring their options, they struck up a collaboration with Lou Reed, releasing the ambitious, arty Lulu in the fall of 2011. In 2012, Metallica launched their own label, Blackened, which would be distributed by Universal. The following year, they announced the release of their second motion picture, Through the Never, which combined spectacular concert footage of them blasting through gems from their back catalog with a surreal road-trip odyssey starring Dane DeHaan. The film and its accompanying soundtrack album were released in September 2013.\r\nOver the next few years, Metallica played the occasional high-profile concert as they worked on a new studio album. In 2016, the band launched a series of expanded reissues, starting with deluxe editions of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning. These reissues were the preamble to the November release of Hardwired...To Self-Destruct, a double album that was the group's first new music in eight years. Produced by Greg Fidelman, James Hetfield, and Lars Ulrich, Hardwired...To Self-Destruct debuted at number one throughout the world upon its November 2016 release. The following year saw the group release a massive, expanded edition of their landmark 1986 LP, Master of Puppets.\r\nIn 2019, Metallica celebrated the 20th anniversary of S&M by reuniting with the San Francisco Symphony for another pair of concerts of orchestral arrangements of their original songs. This provided the source material for 2020's S&M2, a double-live album released in August 2020. Metallica spent 2021 celebrating the 30th anniversary of The Black Album, masterminding a lavish deluxe box set reissue that was accompanied by The Metallica Blacklist, a four-disc tribute album featuring multiple covers of every song on the record. Deliberately eclectic -- the 53-track tribute had contributions by Mac Demarco, Weezer, Jason Isbell, St. Vincent, the Neptunes, Jon Pardi, Phoebe Bridgers, Imelda May and Kamasi Washington -- The Metallica Blacklist was released separately from the big box; it charted at 103 on Billboard's Top 200.\r\nMetallica returned with \"Lux Æterna,\" their first new music in nearly seven years, in November 2022, heralding the April 2023 release of their 11th studio album, 72 Seasons. Reuniting with Greg Fidelman, the co-producer of Hardwired…To Self-Destruct, the band explored concepts of youth and maturity on the muscular, ballad-less album. The LP earned Metallica the prize for Best Metal Performance at the 66th Grammy Awards. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine & Greg Prato",

    summary: "Hailing from Wrexham, Wales, Neck Deep are a pop-punk band whose energetic and hook-driven songwriting has earned them acclaim and chart success on both sides of the Atlantic. After building a grass roots audience in the early 2010s with a pair of self-released EPs, they became a staple of the Hopeless Records roster, lodging a string of U.K. Independent chart-toppers like 2015's Life's Not Out to Get You and 2017's The Peace and the Panic. The latter LP made it to number four on the U.S. pop charts, proving Neck Deep's widespread appeal. Despite weathering a series of lineup changes, the group remained popular heading into the next decade, issuing the 2020 concept album All Distortions Are Intentional and a self-titled 2024 set.\r\nNeck Deep formed in 2012 as the D.I.Y. project of singer Ben Barlow and guitarist Lloyd Roberts. After testing the water with a couple of self-released online tracks, they issued their first EP, Rain in July, in late 2012. Part of an incoming wave of pop-punk revival acts, Neck Deep cited influences like Fall Out Boy, New Found Glory, and Sum 41, offering an updated version of the genre's classic sound. Wanting to expand their capabilities, Barlow and Roberts enlisted friends from the local scene to complete their lineup. Matt West joined on guitar, Fil Thorpe-Evans became their bassist, and Dani Washington joined as drummer. Their second EP, 2013's A History of Bad Decisions, garnered enough attention to bring them to the U.S. for their first international shows, where they caught the attention of several major labels. Neck Deep signed with Hopeless Records in August 2013 and, just a few months later in January 2014, issued their debut, Wishful Thinking. The album was well received, and they spent much of 2014 touring the U.K. and the U.S. supporting bands like We Are the In Crowd and Knuckle Puck, and joining the Vans Warped Tour for a stint. Their sophomore LP, Life's Not Out to Get You, arrived in August 2015, garnering acclaim from fans and critics alike. A lineup change preceded their next effort with Roberts being replaced by Climates and Blood Youth guitarist Sam Bowden. Bowden made his debut on 2017's The Peace and the Panic, which topped charts in the U.K. and hit number four on the Billboard 200. The next year, Neck Deep joined the roster for Songs That Saved My Life, contributing a cover of Ednaswap's \"Torn,\" before Thorpe-Evans left to pursue a production career and was replaced on bass by their former tour photographer, Joshua Halling. In 2019, in anticipation of a summer jaunt with blink-182 and Lil Wayne, the band released the singles \"Don't Tell Me\" and \"She's a God.\"\r\nEarly 2020 saw another line-up change with Barlow's brother Seb taking Halling's place. Neck Deep also grew more experimental, fashioning their next release, All Distortions Are Intentional, as a concept album about the emotional journey of two characters, Jett and Alice. Like their previous album, it topped the U.K. Rock and Independent charts and yielded popular singles like \"When You Know\" and \"Lowlife.\" By 2023, drummer Washington had been replaced by Matt Powles, again altering Neck Deep's chemistry. Undeterred, they set about recording their next album themselves, working together out of their Wrexham studio with Seb Barlow producing. Released in January 2024, the self-titled album was seen as a back-to-basics set that focused on their core attributes, namely melodic songwriting and a brash, energetic rock. ~ Timothy Monger",

    summary: "Pulling the harsh sounds of industrial rock into the mainstream, Trent Reznor and his band Nine Inch Nails became the face of industrial music in the '90s with \"Head Like a Hole,\" \"Closer,\" and \"Hurt\" becoming hits and The Downward Spiral (1994) and The Fragile (1999) topping the charts. Nominated for over a dozen Grammys, NIN won Best Metal Performance awards in 1992 and 1996 for two tracks -- \"Wish\" and \"Happiness in Slavery\" -- from their metallic EP Broken. Extending into the 2000s, Reznor maintained his chart success, even as the band's style shifted to incorporate atmospheric electronic elements influenced by his Oscar-winning film scores. In 2016, after decades as the only official member of the band, he welcomed English producer Atticus Ross -- his longtime film scoring partner and bandmate in side project How to Destroy Angels -- as NIN's official second member. Over the next five years, the duo enjoyed a prolific period that saw additional new film scores as well as NIN projects like 2018's Bad Witch LP and a continuation of their ongoing instrumental Ghosts series which saw two new entries in 2020's Ghosts V: Together and Ghosts VI: Locusts.\r\nMichael Trent Reznor was born May 17, 1965, in New Castle, Pennsylvania and raised in Mercer, a small town outside Pittsburgh. His parents divorced when he was six and he was raised by his maternal grandparents. As a child, Reznor had already developed a keen interest in music. He learned to play piano, tenor sax, and tuba, playing in his school's jazz and marching bands while also acting in high-school productions of Jesus Christ Superstar and The Music Man. Outside of the classical sphere, his biggest rock influence was Kiss, whose theatricality and live shows would later inform NIN's acclaimed stage production. While studying music and computer engineering at local Allegheny College, he was a fleeting member of new wave outfit Option 30, contributing vocals and keyboards before parting ways with the band when he dropped out of school to pursue music full-time. He packed up and moved to Cleveland, Ohio with his friend Chris Vrenna, who later became a founding member of the first incarnation of NIN.\r\nWhile in Cleveland, Reznor was drawn to new wave and the industrial sounds of Ministry and Skinny Puppy. He gigged around town for a few years, playing in cover band the Urge before joining the Innocent as their keyboardist. The latter band released a single full-length, 1985's Livin' in the Street (Red Label Records), before Reznor quit. He soon hooked up with synth pop group Exotic Birds, contributing keys, programming, and backing vocals, while also recruiting Vrenna on drums. Despite their brief run together, Reznor appeared with the band in the 1987 Michael J. Fox/Joan Jett film Light of Day as a fictional band dubbed The Problems. His final roles in the local keyboardist circuit were with pop outfit Slam Bamboo -- they issued a single \"White Lies\"/\"Cry Like a Baby\" in 1988 -- and new wavers Lucky Pierre, whose vocalist Kevin McMahon would later form Prick, one of the first signees to Reznor's future record label, Nothing Records.\r\nDuring these stints, Reznor continued to work on his own material while employed as an assistant engineer and handyman at Cleveland's Right Track studio. When the shop closed for the day, owner Bart Koster allowed Reznor to use the facilities for free. The seeds from these early recording sessions -- on which he played keyboards, drums, guitars, and samplers himself -- would grow into Nine Inch Nails' first demo, Purest Feeling. After making NIN's live debut as tour openers for Skinny Puppy, Reznor shopped the demo tape around the U.S., landing a deal with indie label TVT Records. Reznor quickly returned to the studio to polish existing Purest Feeling tracks and record some new songs. The result, 1989's Pretty Hate Machine, presented a dark, synth-soaked vision of industrial that was also hook-heavy and accessible. Combined with a lyrical focus on sex, self-loathing, betrayal, angst, and religion, these attributes would become hallmarks of Reznor's early-era material. Pretty Hate Machine only peaked at number 75 on the Billboard 200, but a burgeoning cult following helped maintain its chart presence and sales. Buoyed by radio and MTV airplay for singles \"Down in It\" and \"Head Like a Hole,\" it became the first independent release to receive platinum certification to date.\r\nPromotion of Pretty Hate Machine kept the band (then primarily composed of Reznor, Richard Patrick, Chris Vrenna, and various drummers/keyboardists) on the road for years, spreading NIN's fan base across genre lines by not only opening for Skinny Puppy, but also alternative/goth acts the Jesus and Mary Chain and Peter Murphy of Bauhaus. Their American reach expanded in 1991 when they joined inaugural Lollapalooza tour, playing alongside Siouxsie and the Banshees, Living Colour, Violent Femmes, Rollins Band, Lords of Acid, Jane's Addiction, and more. Days after the conclusion of Lollapalooza, NIN shipped off to Europe, opening a pair of shows for Guns N' Roses and penetrating the German industrial market.\r\nWhen NIN returned to the U.S., Reznor became embroiled in a lengthy legal feud with TVT, which was eager to pump out another, similar-sounding hit album, constricting his creativity in the process. In secret, he signed a new deal with Interscope Records and created the vanity label Nothing Records. The band relocated to a new studio in Los Angeles and began recording a batch of aggressive songs inspired by punk and metal. With production by Flood and drumming by Martin Atkins and Vrenna, the Broken EP landed in September 1992, peaking inside the Top Ten on the Billboard 200. In addition to the Grammy-winning single \"Wish,\" the effort also included covers of Adam and the Ants' \"(You're So) Physical\" and Reznor's collaboration with Pigface, \"Suck.\" Reznor enhanced his reputation as a provocateur with a widely banned music video for \"Happiness in Slavery,\" which depicted S&M performance artist Bob Flanagan being torn apart by a machine. There was also a near-mythical, long-form clip for Broken that was never officially released commercially due to its graphic content (a torture victim is dismembered while viewing NIN videos). Bootleg versions became a prized fan commodity and a remastered version found its way onto the Internet in 2006. The Broken era came to a close with NIN's first remix EP, Fixed.\r\nStill based in the Los Angeles studio dubbed Le Pig -- coincidentally built in the same house where actress Sharon Tate was murdered by Charles Manson's followers in 1969 -- Reznor began work on the highly anticipated follow-up to Pretty Hate Machine. A concept album centered on the protagonist's titular descent into self-destruction, The Downward Spiral arrived in March 1994 and debuted at number two. Widely considered to be Reznor's masterwork, The Downward Spiral is often cited as one of the most important albums of the '90s, presenting a bleak, nihilistic version of NIN that would nonetheless break the band into the mainstream. Hit single \"Closer\" was a staple on both MTV and radio, despite its graphic music video and lyrical content, while \"Hurt\" became a live fixture for NIN, receiving a second life in 2003 through Johnny Cash's stripped-down cover version.\r\nThe Downward Spiral was anything but for the band, launching them further into the public consciousness and prompting an industry push for soundalikes Gravity Kills, Stabbing Westward, and Filter on rock radio. NIN promoted the effort with the Self Destruct Tour, which featured Vrenna on drums, James Woolley on keyboards, Robin Finck on guitar, and Danny Lohner on bass. Already a formidable concert presence, NIN's reputation grew with chaotic performances that often ended in destroyed equipment and serious injuries. That intense commitment to their live show reached into American living rooms in the summer of 1994 with their show-stealing, mud-covered set from Woodstock '94, which won them another Grammy for the live recording of \"Happiness in Slavery.\" After the release of the remix album Further Down the Spiral, NIN continued to tour, supported by then-newcomers Marilyn Manson, before joining major influence David Bowie on the co-headlining Dissonance Tour.\r\nDuring this period, Reznor took his first step into the world of film, assembling the soundtrack to Oliver Stone's controversial movie Natural Born Killers, which included the previously unreleased NIN song \"Burn,\" as well as edits of \"Something I Can Never Have\" and \"A Warm Place.\" Another track, a cover of Joy Division's \"Dead Souls,\" was featured on the soundtrack for The Crow. Reznor also contributed vocals to Tori Amos' \"Past the Mission\" from her album Under the Pink.\r\nAfter the conclusion of the Spiral era, NIN entered a period of hibernation. Although Reznor remained active -- producing Marilyn Manson's breakthrough sophomore effort, Antichrist Superstar, and contributing the NIN single \"The Perfect Drug\" to the Reznor-produced soundtrack to David Lynch's Lost Highway -- a growing case of writer's block, struggles with drug and alcohol addiction, and public pressure put a hold on album number three. Encamped at the newly constructed Nothing Studios in New Orleans, a reclusive Reznor spent five years crafting that follow-up, which arrived in 1999.\r\nInfluenced by the passing of Reznor's maternal grandmother, the deterioration of his friendship with Manson, and his increasing addictions, the conceptual double-disc opus The Fragile debuted at the top of the charts and was certified double platinum within months. Meticulously produced by Reznor and Alan Moulder, the album included singles \"We're in This Together,\" \"The Day the World Went Away,\" \"Into the Void,\" and \"Starfuckers, Inc.\" The remix LP Things Falling Apart featured interpretations of Fragile tracks, as well as the unreleased \"10 Miles High\" and Gary Numan cover \"Cars.\" On the supporting Fragility tour, the NIN lineup featured Reznor, Finck, and Lohner, as well as newcomers Charlie Clouser on keyboards and Jerome Dillon on drums. That trek spawned a tour documentary titled And All That Could Have Been, which was accompanied by a live recording and limited-edition EP, Still, which featured stripped-down versions of NIN deep cuts, as well as previously unreleased recordings from the era.\r\nToward the end of the Fragile years, Reznor entered rehab after an unexpected overdose in London, putting NIN on hold until they returned in 2005. Sober and refocused, Reznor inaugurated this new chapter with an equally hungry release, fourth LP With Teeth.\r\nUnlike prior albums, With Teeth traded gloom, frustration, and pain for outward aggression, matured emotions, and Reznor's first attempts at sociopolitical commentary, also marking a turning point for NIN that informed the vocal delivery, production, and collaborative spirit of the band into the next decade. In addition to production by Reznor and Moulder, the taut set featured programming by Atticus Ross and live percussion by Dave Grohl. In addition to being the band's second straight number one, With Teeth also included a trio of chart-topping singles: \"The Hand That Feeds,\" \"Only,\" and \"Every Day Is Exactly the Same.\" A lengthy tour -- featuring the lineup of Reznor, bassist Jeordie White (aka Marilyn Manson's Twiggy Ramirez), keyboardist Alessandro Cortini, guitarist Aaron North, and drummers Josh Freese/Jerome Dillon -- accompanied the release, documented on 2007's Beside You in Time.\r\nWhile the first decade of NIN's existence was marked by mystery and long periods of silence between major releases, the reinvigorated outfit began churning out material in earnest after With Teeth. In early 2007, a multimedia promotional effort was rolled out to earnest fans who deciphered clues found on T-shirts, websites, and strategically placed USB drives placed hidden throughout Europe. Part of a high-concept alternate reality game, they revealed a fictional story of a future dystopian America and a burgeoning resistance movement, all of which was inspired by George W. Bush's presidency and the post-9/11 Iraq invasion. This overtly political concept was at the core of Year Zero, which arrived in April on Interscope Records. Delving deeper into digital soundscapes, Reznor was once again joined by Ross, who was promoted from assistant to producer (a position he would hold until becoming an official member of NIN a decade later). The promotional tour took the band through Europe, Australia, the U.S., and Asia, notable for featuring NIN's first stop in mainland China at the Beijing Pop Festival that September. While a television show and movie were planned to accompany the Year Zero story, those never came to fruition. The album cycle closed with Year Zero Remixed, which featured reinterpretations by Ladytron, Bill Laswell, the Faint, and rapper Saul Williams, whose third effort, 2007's The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!, was produced by Reznor.\r\nDuring this prolific period, NIN also released the four-part ambient instrumental album Ghosts I-IV -- released on Reznor's new label, The Null Corporation -- as well as the surprise album The Slip. Both 2008 efforts were available for free in their digital formats. While The Slip charted outside the Top Ten on the Billboard 200 and the single \"Discipline\" became another rock chart hit, Ghosts was nominated for a pair of Grammy Awards (and the track \"34 Ghosts IV\" would crash the mainstream in an interesting way in 2019). Continuing the direct-to-fans approach, NIN later provided live footage from their accompanying Lights in the Sky tour to online fans, who stitched the pieces together to create a documentary dubbed Another Version of the Truth.\r\nThe next year, NIN embarked on another trek, the forebodingly dubbed Wave Goodbye tour. When the journey concluded, the band entered an official extended hiatus, during which time Reznor and Ross focused on film scores for director David Fincher (2010's Oscar-winning The Social Network, 2011's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and 2014's Gone Girl). The pair also formed a side project with Reznor's wife, Mariqueen Maandig, called How to Destroy Angels. Essentially NIN with a female vocalist, the outfit released a pair of EPs in 2010 and 2012, as well as a full-length album in 2013. Months after the conclusion of their first tour, NIN returned with their eighth album.\r\nThe Grammy-nominated Hesitation Marks (Columbia/The Null Corporation) was issued in August 2013. Produced by Reznor, Ross, and Moulder, it debuted at number three on the charts and included the Top Ten single \"Came Back Haunted\" as well as \"Copy of A\" and \"Everything.\" Guest collaborators on the album included Pino Palladino, Lindsey Buckingham, and Adrian Belew. The ensuing Tension arena tour featured backup vocalists Lisa Fischer and Sharlotte Gibson alongside another revamped lineup that included Reznor, Finck, Cortini, Palladino, drummer Ilan Rubin, and guitarist Josh Eustis. NIN extended the Hesitation Marks cycle into 2014 with a co-headlining tour with fellow '90s mainstays Soundgarden. That same year, NIN were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\r\nThe following year, NIN began the rollout of remastered reissues of past albums. The Fragile appeared in instrumental form exclusively on a streaming platform, with an accompanying collection of instrumental, alternate, and unreleased songs collected as The Fragile: Deviations 1. After the completion of scores for Before the Flood and Patriots Day, Reznor announced a multi-year project that resulted in a NIN EP/short album trilogy, which started with late 2016's Not the Actual Events. A return to the abrasive industrial of the band's earlier days, the five-song set featured the brooding track \"She's Gone Away\" and special guests Mariqueen Maandig, Dave Grohl, and Dave Navarro. Also, after decades of NIN liner notes reading \"Nine Inch Nails is Trent Reznor,\" it was announced that Ross had become a permanent member of the band.\r\nIn the summer of 2017, the second installment of the series arrived. Add Violence debuted in the Top 20 and spawned the radio hit \"Less Than,\" which climbed the Mainstream Rock and Alternative Songs charts. A year later, the trilogy ended with Bad Witch, which was officially issued as the band's ninth album. Notable for lead single \"God Break Down the Door\" -- featuring jazz saxophone and Reznor singing with a Bowie-esque croon -- Bad Witch also included vocals from the Cult's Ian Astbury and Mariqueen Maandig on \"Shit Mirror.\" In support of the effort, NIN embarked on a 2018 tour dubbed Cold and Black and Infinite, which reunited Reznor with the Jesus and Mary Chain after opening for them almost three decades prior.\r\nIn 2019, NIN experienced a pop culture resurgence, reaching a fresh audience through some unlikely sources. In addition to a savvy pairing with Captain Marvel -- which saw the titular superhero donning a vintage NIN shirt throughout much of the film -- the band returned to the charts through a clever cover (a pop makeover of \"Head Like a Hole\" called \"On a Roll,\" which was performed by fictional pop star Ashley O, depicted by Miley Cyrus) and a strategic sample (Lil Nas X's use of \"34 Ghosts IV\" in his record-breaking hit single \"Old Town Road,\" which later made Reznor and Ross Country Music Award winners). To close the year, the pair crafted a trio of very NIN-esque scores for the HBO series Watchmen.\r\nAt the start of the 2020s, as the world was in the grip of a global pandemic, NIN revived their Ghosts series with the sequels Ghosts V: Together and Ghosts VI: Locusts, nearly two-dozen additions to the series inspired by the need for connection in an uncertain time. NIN were also inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as part of the Class of 2020 (by Iggy Pop no less), which would be celebrated years later as the pandemic eased. In the interim, Reznor and Ross won another Oscar for their score to the animated film Soul, hopped onto HEALTH's song \"Isn't Everyone,\" and produced Halsey's Grammy-nominated If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power. In 2022, NIN were finally able to celebrate their Rock Hall induction with a historic hometown show in Cleveland that featured a surprise encore featuring Richard Patrick, Chris Vrenna, Danny Lohner, Alessandro Cortini, Robin Finck, Ilan Rubin, and Charlie Clouser. In addition to performing a selection of early NIN classics, they even performed Filter's \"Hey Man Nice Shot.\"\r\nWhile NIN remained quiet through 2023, Reznor and Ross appeared on Fever Ray's \"Even It Out\" from Radical Romantics and they crafted scores for Bones and All, Empire of Light, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, The Killer, and Challengers. ~ Neil Z.

    summary: "One of the first bands to fuse revivalist ska with the energy and aggression of post-hardcore punk rock (after the Mighty Mighty Bosstones), Operation Ivy were also one of the few ska-punk bands to earn critical acclaim. Part of the reason was that they were one of the genre's innovators, possessed of a freshness that many of their imitators lacked, but their lyrics were often more intelligent and substantive as well. Thanks to their early breakup (the group was only together for two years), Operation Ivy became an enduring, even legendary influence in the neo-punk underground, especially after half of the band went on to hit it big in a new group, Rancid.\r\nOperation Ivy were formed in Berkeley, CA, in May 1987 out of the ashes of several local bands. Lead singer Jesse Michaels, guitarist Lint (born Tim Armstrong), bassist Matt McCall (born Matt Freeman, renamed after the hero of the TV series The Equalizer), and drummer Dave Mello began playing extensively at the famed Gilman Street club, a center of the Bay Area's burgeoning punk revival scene. (Initially, they had no horn section, though sax player Paul Bae would later join them on selected recordings.) They quickly signed with the local punk label Lookout, and appeared on two compilations by the end of the year: the label sampler The Thing That Ate Floyd, and the Maximum Rock'n'Roll magazine sampler Turn It Around. In 1988, they released an EP titled Hectic and toured the country, playing small-scale punk venues.\r\nWith a budding reputation as an excellent live band, EMI offered Operation Ivy a major-label deal. Unsure of how to react to the prospect of success -- both because of their independent politics and local-mindedness -- the band chose to break up rather than compromise their intentions, playing their last show in May 1989. Their debut full-length album, Energy, was released on Lookout several months later, and became a touchstone of the third wave ska revival largely through word of mouth. Michaels went on to sing with Big Rig before leaving music; varying accounts hold that he became either a Buddhist monk or a Central American missionary, and may have returned to the U.S. to work for Lookout. Mello joined Schlong and then reunited briefly with Armstrong and Freeman in Downfall, which released an album on Lookout in 1995. Armstrong and Freeman, reverting to their real names, formed Rancid in 1991; their Clash-inspired punk and ska helped make them one of the most popular bands of the '90s punk revival, after Green Day and the Offspring. ~ Steve Huey",

    summary: "Orgy was formed in Los Angeles, California in 1997 and signed to Korn's Elementree record label soon after. They quickly released their first album, \"Candyass.\" Soon after, they performed the duty of opening act on the Family Values tour in '98, where they were introduced to many for the first time. Around then, they had their first hit with a cover of New Order's Blue Monday, followed with successful singles for Stitches and Fiction (Dreams in Digital). After the release of their second album, \"Vapor Transmission\", they left Elementree records, and largely disappeared from the public eye. Bobby briefly joined Snake River Conspiracy for a while, and Jay formed his own independent record label, D1 Music, with his father. In 2004, Orgy's third album, \"Punk Statik Paranoia,\" was released under D1, but with little to no radio play or recognition from the mainstream music media. Ryan and Amir have also started a side project known as Julien-K, with a much more electronic focus, and have released a song featuring the vocals of Chester Bennington of Linkin Park on the recent Underworld Evolution soundtrack. They have since formed the project Dead By Sunrise with Bennington. Amir Derakh was immortalised in the Coal Chamber song Amir of the Desert. He produced their debut album. Jay Gordon appeared on the follow up \"Chamber Music\". When asked for an Orgy update in late July 2008, Shuck informed fans that Orgy's return is still underway but their priority is getting the much delayed Julien-K album released. During a video interview at the annual Californian NAMM 2009 convention, Derakh mentioned a 2010 Orgy reunion. On March 30, 2010, through a video to his Julien-K, Dead By Sunrise, and Orgy followers, Shuck informed that there are plans for a tour in 2010. On October 25, 2010, Ryan Shuck and Amir Derakh informed on the Julien-K blog that \"As of Oct. 26th we will no longer be part of Orgy. Jay will continue making music without the original members. On October 30, 2010, Jay Gordon released a statement via his official Facebook profile stating that he still owns the Orgy name and wants to continue forth creating new material for the band. Jay wrote that all previous members of the band were too busy with numerous side-projects to continue with the original band. On November 7, 2011, Blabbermouth.net published a news story detailing the bitter feud between vocalist Gordon and guitarists Shuck and Derakh that has spiraled out of control after Gordon revealing his plans to assemble a band of musicians and begin touring under the name Orgy. On February 3, 2012, it was announced that Orgy would embark on a five-week run titled the Bad Blood Tour. The new lineup features members of Deadsy, Snot, and Run Run Run. Vocalist Jay Gordon is the only original member of Orgy appearing on this tour; the support acts are the Texas-based One-Eyed Doll Cleveland-based industrial metal band Ventana and Faultline from Richmond, Virginia. The band has reportedly been in the studio in recent weeks recording new material, including a collaboration with Skrillex. This was confirmed after they cancelled the last five shows of their tour. On August 4, 2012, Orgy linked to a 30 second demo of a new song, \"Grime of the Century\" via their Twitter and Facebook page. In 2013, Orgy embarked on the Wide Awake and Dead Tour with Vampires Everywhere! and Davey Suicide. Read more on Last.fm.

    summary: "Washington, D.C.'s Periphery push at the boundaries of progressive metal, utilizing detuned, extended-range instruments to create a sound that's as technically dizzying as it is relentlessly heavy. Using a framework laid down by djent pioneers like Meshuggah and running wild with it, the group issued an eponymous debut in 2010. Periphery hit their stride with the double-LP Juggernaut (2015) and the diverse Periphery III: Select Difficulty (2016), the latter of which earned them a Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance. The band elicited accolades on subsequent efforts, Periphery IV: Hail Stan (2019) and Periphery V: Djent Is Not a Genre (2023), for their commitment to innovation and experimentation.\r\nPeriphery started in 2005 as the recording project of guitarist and producer Misha Mansoor. Mansoor had already made a name for himself in the progressive metal community through his production abilities with his project Bulb. He created Periphery as an evolution of his earlier work, taking the music out of the studio and onto the road; he fleshed out the band with a lineup that included guitarists Alex Bois and Jake Bowen, bassist Tom Murphy, drummer Matt Halpern, and, after running through a few vocalists, singer Spencer Sotelo. Periphery released their self-titled debut in 2010 on Sumerian, then quickly went out on the road, touring the U.S. and Canada, as well as making stops in Australia and the U.K. The following year, the band released their first EP, Icarus. Leading up to 2012's Periphery II: This Time It's Personal, Mark Holcomb replaced Bois on guitar and Adam Getgood replaced Murphy on bass. The album earned positive reviews from critics and debuted just outside the Top 40 on the main Billboard albums chart. By 2015, the band had readied a double album for Sumerian. Comprising two halves, Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega both appeared on the same day in January 2015, earning yet more positive reviews for the band and even higher chart placements, topping out at number 22 on Billboard. Although Juggernaut took six months to record, the group wasted no time reentering the studio to record the follow-up. The resulting full-length, Periphery III: Select Difficulty, appeared in July 2016, and was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. In 2018 the band split with Sumerian, and in 2019 they issued their sixth studio long-player, Periphery IV: Hail Stan, on their own independent label 3DOT Recordings. The LP added live orchestration and choir to the group's ever-evolving sound. The following year, the band released their first concert LP, Live in London. Periphery V: Djent Is Not a Genre appeared in 2023 and received considerable acclaim for its uncompromising sound and innovative craftsmanship. ~ Gregory Heaney",

    summary: "Guitar-bending instrumental group Polyphia have distinguished themselves as prog rock mavericks, playing a style that falls somewhere between blisteringly fast metal-god virtuosity and pure pop. They first grabbed attention in 2013 after the track \"Impassion\" went viral. Since then, albums like 2014's Muse and 2016's Renaissance have found them further honing their technically brilliant instrumental sound, combining sophisticated pop hooks with face-melting guitar solos. Later on, the group added elements of hip-hop, EDM, and jazz to their repertoire with diverse outings like New Levels New Devils (2018) and Remember That You Will Die (2022).\r\nFormed in the quiet suburban landscape of Plano, Texas in 2011, Polyphia initially consisted of dual lead guitarists Tim Henson and Scott LePage, bassist Clay Gober, and drummer Brandon Burkhalter. They released two EPs, 2011's Resurrect (their only recording to feature vocals) and 2013's Inspire, before recording their 2014 full-length debut, Muse. Funds for the recording and production of Muse were raised by the band in an online fundraising campaign to which fans generously donated. The self-released album charted in the Top 100 of Billboard's album chart, and Equal Vision signed Polyphia, reissuing the album in 2015.\r\nBy the time the album was reissued, Burkhalter had been temporarily replaced by new drummer Randy Methe. However, Burkhalter rejoined the band in time to record their second album, 2016's Renaissance, which appeared on Equal Vision in March of that year. Co-produced by Nick Sampson, along with Henson and LePage, the album was the first to feature the group as a trio and found them further incorporating pop and R&B influences into their sound. Following the album's released, Burkhalter once again left the band, replaced by drummer Clay Gober. The six-track EP The Most Hated followed a year later, spearheaded by the lively single \"40 oz.,\" which once again delivered a genre-defying blast of technical shredding that drew inspiration from jazz, R&B, electronic, and hip-hop. In 2018, Polyphia issued their third full-length album, New Levels New Devils, which featured production from Judge and Y2K, and included the tracks \"Yas\" and \"G.O.A.T.\" The band continued to explore trap percussion and hip-hop on 2022's wide-ranging Remember That You Will Die, which dabbled in bubblegum pop and bossa nova, and featured guest spots from Sophia Black, Steve Vai, and Brasstracks, among others. ~ Fred Thomas",

    summary: "Queens of the Stone Age emerged from the stoner rock underground of the 1990s to become one of the leading heavy rock bands of the 21st century, a transition sparked by the release of their major-label debut, Rated R, in 2000. A murky immersion in chemical excess, the album showcased QOTSA's skill in wedding thick, grimy guitars with shape-shifting psychedelia, a blend suited for the desert that frontman Josh Homme called home. Over the years, Homme remained the lone constant in QOTSA's mercurial lineup, anchoring the group as members and guests cycled through the studio and stage. Dave Grohl's presence on the drumkit on 2002's Songs for the Deaf helped break the band to a wider audience in America, placing them at the vanguard of hard rock music. QOTSA's membership stabilized around the release of …Like Clockwork, the 2013 record that returned them to indie status while giving them their first number one album on the Billboard charts. Homme maintained the same quintet through the Mark Ronson-produced Villains and In Times New Roman..., a 2023 album that found them discovering new shades and textures within their palette.\r\nQueens of the Stone Age has its roots in Kyuss, the stoner rock band Josh Homme led during the early '90s. After Kyuss split in 1995, Homme served as a supporting guitarist on a Screaming Trees tour, then decided to launch a new band called Gamma Ray. An eponymous EP appeared in 1996 before a German metal band named Gamma Ray threatened legal action over the appellation. Taking a cue from a nickname bestowed on the group by producer Chris Goss, Homme decided to rename his fledgling unit Queens of the Stone Age, unveiling this moniker on the Roadrunner various-artists compilation Burn One Up! Music for Stoners in 1997. Later that year, the split EP Kyuss/Queens of the Stone Age -- comprised of old tunes from the latter and new material from the former -- confirmed the transition between Homme's two groups.\r\nHomme co-produced Queens of the Stone Age's eponymous 1998 debut with Joe Barresi, which was released on Loosegroove, the indie imprint from Pearl Jam's Stone Gossard and Regan Hagar. With Alfredo Hernandez on drums, Homme played all the guitars and most of the bass and keyboards on the record, but he soon expanded QOTSA into a touring outfit featuring former Kyuss bassist Nick Oliveri along with guitarist Dave Catching; the latter played on the first volume of Homme's shape-shifting collaborative project the Desert Sessions, which appeared in 1997. This group was by no means secure. By the time QOTSA entered the studio to record their major-label debut Rated R, Hernandez was no longer with the band; Nick Lucero and Gene Trautmann split drumming duties on the record.\r\nCo-produced by Homme and Goss and released on Interscope, Rated R built QOTSA's audience exponentially. \"The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret\" gave the band a Top 40 hit in the U.K. Live spots at Ozzfest and with Foo Fighters and Hole helped broaden their following, while events like Oliveri getting arrested after performing nude at the 2001 Rock in Rio Festival helped generate headlines. All this buzz culminated in Foo Fighters leader -- and former Nirvana drummer -- Dave Grohl becoming a temporary member of QOTSA for 2002's Songs for the Deaf and its 2022 supporting tour, which featured Homme, Oliveri, Grohl, ex-Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan, and A Perfect Circle guitarist/keyboardist Troy Van Leeuwen. With its singles \"No One Knows\" and \"Go with the Flow,\" Songs for the Deaf elevated Queens of the Stone Age into the upper ranks of modern rock acts, acting as a heavy, trippy counterpart to the prevailing neo-garage rock of the early 2000s.\r\nGrohl decamped at the conclusion of the Songs for the Deaf tour, returning to his regular gig in Foo Fighters; he was replaced by Joey Castillo, who previously drummed with Danzig. In the wake of QOTSA's success, Homme embraced a variety of outside gigs, including playing on a pair of Mark Lanegan albums and collaborating with Jesse Hughes on Peace, Love, Death Metal, the first album by their band Eagles of Death Metal. When it came time to reconvene QOTSA for a sequel to Songs for the Deaf, the band no longer featured Nick Oliveri; Homme fired him due to issues in the bassist's personal life. With Alain Johannes taking over for Oliveri, the group finished recording Lullabies to Paralyze, making space for guest appearances by ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons and Shirley Manson. Preceded by the single \"Little Sister,\" Lullabies to Paralyze appeared in March 2005, followed by a supporting tour that occasionally featured Lanegan in his last live outings with the band.\r\nChris Goss returned to co-produce 2007's Era Vulgaris alongside Homme. Featuring fewer guests than usual -- Julian Casablancas of the Strokes appeared on the single \"Sick, Sick Sick,\" Lanegan provided vocals on one track -- Era Vulgaris appeared in June 2007, wrapping up the band's contract with Interscope. After a supporting tour featuring bassist Michael Shuman and keyboardist Dean Fertita -- the pair would become steady members of QOTSA from this point forward -- the band went into a period of inactivity as Homme pursued other projects over the next few years. Chief among these was Them Crooked Vultures, a power trio also featuring Dave Grohl and Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones, who released an eponymous album in 2009. The next year saw a deluxe reissue of Rated R and in 2011, the band reissued their hard-to-find debut and did a small supporting tour behind this deluxe edition.\r\nQueens of the Stone Age began recording a new album in 2012, transitioning from drummer Joey Castillo to his replacement Jon Theodore during the sessions. The record found QOTSA bringing Grohl back into the fold while also finding spots for Mark Lanegan, Trent Reznor, Alex Turner, Jake Shears, and Elton John, as well as Nick Oliveri for his first spot on a QOTSA album in a decade. With the finished album in hand, Queens of the Stone Age signed with Matador in 2013 and the ensuing ...Like Clockwork album was released in June of that year. Supported by the singles \"My God Is the Sun\" and \"I Sat by the Ocean,\" ...Like Clockwork topped the Billboard 200, as well as the Alternative, Digital, Hard Rock, Independent, and Top Rock charts. Following the success of ...Like Clockwork, Homme and various Queens' members participated in the Sound City documentary project and Iggy Pop's 2016 Post Pop Depression album and tour. For Villains, the band's seventh album, QOTSA worked with Mark Ronson and invited Nikka Costa and Matt Sweeney into the studio as guests. Featuring the singles \"The Way You Used to Do\" and \"The Evil Has Landed,\" Villains debuted at three on the Billboard charts upon its August 2017 release.\r\nAfter the Villains tour, Queens of the Stone Age took an extended hiatus, reemerging in June 2023 with In Times New Roman…, their third album for Matador. It was the first QOTSA album to be produced by the band and not to feature any guests. It earned the group a pair of Grammy nominations for Best Rock Album and Best Rock Song for \"Emotion Sickness.\" ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "Outspoken firebrands and activists Rage Against the Machine have educated masses of heavy music fans by injecting their bombastic Molotov cocktail of rap, hardcore punk, funk, and metal with a sobering dose of fiercely polemical, politically charged urgency. Crashing the mainstream in 1992 with \"Killing in the Name\" -- their sonic protest against police brutality and systemic racism -- the band planted their flag in the scene with their triple-platinum debut, Rage Against the Machine, which courted controversy with its graphic cover of a protesting, self-immolated Buddhist monk. For the remainder of the decade, Rage continued to push this anti-authoritarian and revolutionary message, extending their platinum streak with subsequent chart-topping Grammy winners Evil Empire (1996) and The Battle of Los Angeles (1999). At the turn of the millennium, it seemed like they would show no signs of relenting, balancing sales and chart success with headline-grabbing demonstrations (like shutting down the New York Stock Exchange for a video shoot). However, in late 2000, the band imploded and decided to take a break. After issuing a covers album, Renegades, members went on to pursue other projects, with vocalist Zack de la Rocha going solo and the rest of the group forming Audioslave with Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell. Into the 2010s, a rumored comeback album never materialized, but the band remained a fixture on the cultural landscape, performing shows and working on side projects such as Prophets of Rage. At the turn of the next decade, Rage made another official comeback, charting a global reunion tour in 2020 that was sidelined by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. That same year, in the midst of international protests against police brutality, their seminal debut struck a chord with demonstrators, reentering the U.S. charts as every one of their albums hit the Top 30 on streaming services.\r\nTaking aim at corporate America, cultural imperialism, and government oppression, Rage Against the Machine formed in Los Angeles in the early '90s out of the wreckage of a number of local groups: vocalist Zack de la Rocha (the son of Chicano political artist Robert de la Rocha) emerged from the bands Headstance, Farside, and Inside Out; guitarist Tom Morello (the nephew of Jomo Kenyatta, the first Kenyan president) originated in Lock Up; and drummer Brad Wilk played with future Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder. Rounded out by bassist Tim Commerford, a childhood friend of de la Rocha's, Rage debuted in 1992 with a self-released, self-titled 12-song cassette featuring the song \"Bullet in the Head,\" which became a hit when reissued as a single later in the year. The tape won the band a deal with Epic, and their leap to the majors did not go unnoticed by detractors, who questioned the revolutionary integrity of Rage Against the Machine's decision to align itself with the label's parent company, media behemoth Sony.\r\nUndeterred, the quartet made their official major-label debut with Rage Against the Machine, scoring hits with singles like \"Killing in the Name\" and \"Bombtrack.\" After touring with Lollapalooza and declaring their support of groups like FAIR (Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting), Rock for Choice, and Refuse & Resist, Rage spent a reportedly tumultuous four years working on their follow-up. Despite rumors of a breakup, they returned in 1996 with Evil Empire, which entered the U.S. album charts at number one and scored a hit single with \"Bulls on Parade.\" The track \"Tire Me\" went on to win a Grammy for Best Metal Performance. In 1997, the band charted a summer tour with rap group Wu-Tang Clan (the Wu later dropped off the tour and the Roots replaced them) and remained active in support of various leftist political causes, including a controversial 1999 benefit concert for death-row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal. Third album The Battle of Los Angeles followed in 1999, also debuting at number one and going double platinum by the following summer. Album single \"Guerrilla Radio\" scored Rage a second Grammy, this time for Best Hard Rock Performance. A live set from the era -- The Battle of Mexico City -- was recorded for a documentary of the same name and released in 2001 (it finally appeared on vinyl on its 20th anniversary in 2021).\r\nIn early 2000, de la Rocha announced plans for a solo project and the band performed an incendiary show outside the Democratic National Convention in August (and months later stirred things up outside the Republican National Convention). In between, bassist Commerford was arrested for disorderly conduct at MTV's Video Music Awards following his bizarre disruption of a Limp Bizkit acceptance speech. Plans for a live album were announced shortly thereafter, but in October, de la Rocha abruptly announced his departure from the band, citing breakdowns in communication and group decision-making. Surprised but not angry, the remainder of Rage announced plans to continue with a new vocalist, while de la Rocha refocused on his solo album, which was slated to include collaborations with acclaimed hip-hop artists including DJ Shadow and El-P of Company Flow. December 2000 saw the release of de la Rocha's final studio effort with the band, the Rick Rubin-produced Renegades; it featured nearly a dozen covers of hip-hop, rock, and punk artists like EPMD, Bruce Springsteen, Devo, the Rolling Stones, the MC5, and more. By 2001, Morello, Wilk, and Commerford had formed Audioslave with Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell, and the group released an eponymous album by the end of 2002. With a de la Rocha solo album still not announced, Epic finally released the long-promised concert album Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium on CD and DVD in time for Christmas 2003.\r\nOver the next few years, rumors of a Rage Against the Machine reunion always swirled but never came to fruition. Two Audioslave albums followed in 2005 and 2006 before the group split, then the next year Morello began releasing protest folk-punk as the Nightwatchman. That year also brought the long-anticipated Rage Against the Machine reunion. First, the band played the closing day of 2007's Coachella festival, then in 2008 several other gigs followed, usually coinciding with major festivals in Europe and the U.S. No new studio work from Rage Against the Machine materialized, but de la Rocha collaborated with former Mars Volta drummer Jon Theodore in a group called One Day as a Lion, releasing an EP that year.\r\nThe next burst of Rage activity came in 2009 when there was an Internet campaign to get \"Killing in the Name\" to the top of the U.K. charts, all in the hopes of thwarting an X Factor winner from taking the pole position. The viral campaign worked and Rage played a free celebratory concert at Finsbury Park in the summer of 2010. Despite all these gigs -- including a summer 2011 appearance at L.A. Rising, a festival the band arranged -- and word of a new album, no recordings appeared. In 2013, their debut album received a deluxe reissue and, two years later, the 2010 Finsbury Park gig was issued as a CD/DVD release. The next year, Morello, Wilk, and Commerford joined forces with Public Enemy's Chuck D and Cypress Hill's B Real to form the supergroup Prophets of Rage, releasing a self-titled album in 2017.\r\nAs 2019 came to a close, Rage kicked off a new decade with more reports of a comeback. Coachella appearances were later confirmed, the start of a global trek that would pair the veteran band with like-minded rap duo (and frequent de la Rocha collaborators) Run the Jewels. However, plans were halted by March, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced cancellations of most live music for 2020. That June, as protests against police brutality broke out around the world following the death of George Floyd, Rage's albums returned to Billboard and streaming charts. ~ Neil Z.

    summary: "The Ramones may or may not have invented punk rock, but they were inarguably the most important band in punk history, creating the stylistic prototype that would be followed by countless bands who emerged in their wake. They were informed by the thunder and flash of the Who and the MC5, the speed and primitivism of Iggy and the Stooges, and the alternately sullen and goofy musings of '60s garage rock, but the Ramones synthesized their influences into something raw and revolutionary, a fury of pounding rhythms and downstroked guitars married to rudimentary melodies and comically absurd lyrics that both mocked and celebrated popular culture and teenage life. The Ramones were tuneful, aggressive, and challenging in their embrace of minimalist fury, and while bands from the Clash and the Sex Pistols to Rancid and Green Day would build on their formula, it's essentially impossible to imagine any of those bands, or punk as we know it, without the Ramones' guiding example. Their first four albums -- Ramones (1976), Leave Home (1977), Rocket to Russia (1978), and Road to Ruin (1979) -- were defining works for the band and the movement they helped inspire, and songs like \"Blitzkrieg Bop,\" \"Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue,\" \"Pinhead,\" \"Rockaway Beach,\" and \"I Wanna Be Sedated\" would become anthems even if they were never embraced by radio. From 1980 onward, the Ramones recorded a long series of albums in which they often toyed with their formula in an effort to attract a larger audience (working with legendary producer Phil Spector on 1980's End of the Century, adding keyboard accents on 1986's Animal Boy, recording a batch of covers on 1993's Acid Eaters), though their best work of this era (especially 1984's Too Tough to Die) was usually their most elemental, as they focused on what they did first and best.\r\nBased in the Forest Hills section of Queens, New York, the Ramones formed in 1974. Originally, the band was a trio consisting of Joey Ramone (vocals, drums; born Jeffrey Hyman, May 19, 1951), Johnny Ramone (guitar; born John Cummings, October 8, 1951), and Dee Dee Ramone (bass; born Douglas Colvin, September 18, 1951), with Tommy Ramone (born Tom Erdelyi, January 29, 1952) acting as the group's manager. All of the group's members adopted the last name \"Ramone\" and dressed in torn blue jeans and leather jackets, in homage to '50s greaser rockers. The group played their first concert on March 30, 1974, at New York's Performance Studio. Two months after the show, Joey switched to vocals and Tommy became the band's drummer. By the end of the summer, the Ramones had earned a residency at CBGB. For the next year, they played regularly at the nightclub, earning a dedicated cult following and inspiring several other artists to form bands with similar ideals. All of the Ramones sets clocked in at about 20 minutes, featuring an unrelenting barrage of short, barely two-minute songs. By the end of 1975, the Ramones secured a recording contract with Sire; discounting Patti Smith, they were the first New York punk band to sign a contract.\r\nEarly in 1976, the Ramones recorded their debut album for just over $6,000.00. The resulting album, Ramones, was released in the spring, gained some critical attention, and managed to climb to 111 on the U.S. album charts. On July 4, the band made their debut appearance in Britain, where their records were becoming a big influence on a new generation of bands. Throughout 1976, the Ramones toured constantly, inaugurating nearly 20 years of relentless touring. By the end of the year, the group released their second album, Ramones Leave Home. While the album just scraped the U.S. charts, Leave Home became a genuine hit in England in the spring of 1977, peaking at number 48. By the summer of 1977, the Sex Pistols and the Ramones were seen as the two key bands in the punk rock revolution, but where the Pistols imploded, the Ramones kept on rolling. Following the U.K. Top 40 hit \"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker,\" the Ramones released their third album, Rocket to Russia, in the fall of 1977.\r\nTommy Ramone left the band in the spring of 1977, although he produced the group's subsequent album. He was replaced by former Voidoid Marc Bee, who immediately changed his name to Marky Ramone. With their new drummer in place, the Ramones recorded their fourth album, Road to Ruin, which was released in the fall. Road to Ruin marked the band's first significant attempt to change their sound; not only were there stronger bubblegum, girl group, surf, and '60s pop influences on the music, it was the first of their albums to run over a half-hour. Although their sound was more accessible, it didn't gain the band a noticeably larger following. Neither did Rock N' Roll High School, the 1979 Roger Corman film in which the Ramones had a pivotal part. The soundtrack to Rock N' Roll High School and the U.K.-only live album It's Alive were the band's only releases of 1979. For most of the year, they were in the studio recording their fifth album with legendary '60s pop producer Phil Spector. The title song to the Corman movie was the first track released from the sessions, although the soundtrack album did feature a number of older Ramones songs remixed by Spector. End of the Century, the Spector-produced Ramones album, finally appeared in January of 1980 to mixed reviews. Despite the lukewarm reception to the album, the record's cover of the Ronettes' \"Baby I Love You\" became their only Top Ten British hit; in America, none of the singles made an impact, although the record became their biggest hit, peaking at number 44.\r\nThe Ramones continued their attempts at crossover success with their sixth album, Pleasant Dreams, which was released in 1981. Featuring a production by former Hollies and 10cc member Graham Gouldman, the record was a commercial disappointment in both America and England. The band was relatively quiet during 1982, spending most of their time touring. In the spring of 1983, the band returned with Subterranean Jungle, which was produced by Ritchie Cordell and Glen Koltkin, the heads of the American indie label Beserkley Records. Not only did Subterranean Jungle fail to gain the band the larger audience they desired, it continued the erosion of the band's die-hard fan base, as well as their decline in the eyes of many rock critics. Following the album's release, Marky Ramone left the band; he was replaced by Richard Beau, a former member of the Velveteens, who changed his name to Richie Ramone.\r\nWith 1984's Too Tough to Die, the Ramones delivered a belated response to America's burgeoning hardcore punk scene that was largely produced by Tommy Erdelyi. The album helped restore their artistic reputation, as did the 1985 single \"Bonzo Goes to Bitburg,\" an attack on President Ronald Reagan's 1985 visit to Germany. Instead of continuing with the sound of Too Tough to Die, the Ramones began pursuing a more streamlined, stylized, and conventional take on their songwriting formula with 1986's Animal Boy. This was a direction the group followed for the remaining ten years of their career. Following the release of 1987's Halfway to Sanity, Richie Ramone left the band and Marky Ramone re-joined the group. In 1988, the career retrospective Ramones Mania appeared. In 1989, the Ramones contributed the theme song to the Stephen King movie Pet Semetary, and the track was included on Brain Drain, which was released in the summer of that year. After its release, the group's bassist, Dee Dee Ramone, left the band to pursue a career as a rapper called Dee Dee King; after his debut rap recording failed miserably, he formed the band Chinese Dragons. Dee Dee was replaced by C.J. Ramone (born Christopher John Ward).\r\nIn the early '90s, the Ramones sobered up, with both Joey and Marky undergoing treatment for alcoholism. The band returned to recording in 1992, first releasing the live Loco Live and then Mondo Bizarro, their first studio album in three years. Mondo Bizarro turned out to be a commercial failure, as did their 1994 covers album, Acid Eaters. Following the release of Acid Eaters, the mainstream guitar rock audience in America finally embraced punk rock in the form of young bands like Green Day and the Offspring. Sensing that the climate may have been right for the crossover success they had desired for so many years, the Ramones immediately followed Acid Eaters with Adios Amigos, claiming that unless the new album sold in substantial numbers, the band would call it quits after a final farewell tour. Adios Amigos only spent two weeks in the charts. Nevertheless, the Ramones embarked on a long farewell tour that ran throughout the rest of 1995. The band was set to split in the beginning of 1996 when they were offered a slot on the sixth Lollapalooza, and they toured with the festival that summer.\r\nFollowing the completion of the tour, the Ramones parted ways, 20 years after the release of their first album. Just a few years later, Joey Ramone passed away on April 15, 2001, at age 49, the victim of lymphoma. Little more than a year after Joey's death, Dee Dee Ramone was found dead in his home in Los Angeles on June 5, 2002. Johnny Ramone passed away two years later on September 15, 2004 after a long battle with cancer. Ten years later, on July 11, 2014, Tommy Ramone -- the last remaining member of the original Ramones foursome -- died of cancer at his home in Queens, New York. Despite the passing of all four original members, the Ramones' legacy continued to be celebrated in a series of new archival projects. In 2016, Rhino Records coordinated a Super Deluxe 40th Anniversary Edition of the band's 1976 debut, featuring a wealth of alternate takes, an unreleased live concert, and an LP featuring a newly created mono mix of the album. Similarly expanded versions of Leave Home and Rocket to Russia followed in 2017, and a Super Deluxe Road to Ruin appeared in 2018. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine & Mark Deming",

    summary: "Slipknot's mix of grinding, post-Korn alternative metal, Marilyn Manson-esque neo-shock rock, and rap-metal helped make them one of the most popular bands in the nu-metal explosion of the late 1990s and early 2000s. But even more helpful was their theatrical, attention-grabbing image: the band always performed in identical industrial jump suits and homemade Halloween masks, and added to their mysterious anonymity by adopting the numbers zero through eight as stage aliases. Add to that a lyrical preoccupation with darkness and nihilism, and an affectionately insulting name for their fans (\"Maggots\"), and Slipknot's blueprint for nu-metal success was set. Emerging in 1995, the Grammy Award-winning band issued their eponymous debut album in 1999 and went mainstream with subsequent gold and platinum efforts like Iowa (2001), All Hope Is Gone (2008), We Are Not Your Kind (2019), and The End, So Far (2022).\r\nSlipknot were formed in late 1995 in the unlikely locale of Des Moines, Iowa; after some early personnel shifts, the nine-piece lineup settled around (in order from number zero to number eight): DJ Sid Wilson, drummer Joey Jordison, bassist Paul Gray, percussionist Chris Fehn, guitarist James Root, sampler/programmer Craig Jones, percussionist Shawn \"Clown\" Crahan, guitarist Mick Thomson, and lead vocalist Corey Taylor. The music scene in Des Moines wasn't much to speak of, and the band's big-time ambition was usually met with disbelief and ridicule, which provided the initial spark for its mostly anonymous stage visuals. On Halloween 1996, Slipknot self-released an album called Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat., which built a buzz around the group once it found its way to several labels. It was picked up for distribution by the Nebraska-based -ismist label and caught the attention of Roadrunner Records, which signed Slipknot in 1997. Working with producer Ross Robinson, the band recorded their official self-titled debut album and released it in 1999. They gradually built an audience through near-constant touring, working their way up to the summer Ozzfest package tour. Their live shows were a much-discussed hit with metal fans, and the band performed with such energy that Crahan gashed his head open on his own drum kit twice that summer, requiring stitches both times. In early 2000, Slipknot was certified platinum; the first such album in Roadrunner's history.\r\nThe anticipation for Slipknot's follow-up was intense, and the band's sophomore effort, Iowa, bowed at number three upon its release in 2001. More heavy touring followed, including another, more prominent slot on that summer's Ozzfest. After a long spell on the road, Slipknot took a break while the members worked on side projects. The band set up its own label, Maggot Recordings, and signed a band called Downthesun, whose lead singer had served as Crahan's drum technician. Wilson began DJ'ing solo under the name DJ Starscream, and Root and Thomson both worked on solo material. Drummer Jordison worked with a side group called the Rejects, where he'd actually served for quite some time as guitarist. Taylor, meanwhile, started a side band called Superego, and also contributed a solo song, \"Bother,\" to the soundtrack of the 2002 blockbuster Spider-Man. That year, guitarist Joey Jordison and Static-X guitarist Tripp Eisen teamed up for the Murderdolls project, while Taylor re-formed his old band Stone Sour and released an album.\r\nIn August 2003, Slipknot decamped Iowa for L.A., where they began work on the new record with producer Rick Rubin. \"Pulse of the Maggots\" appeared in early 2004 as an exclusive download. The band then embarked on a brief tour as a warm-up for their dates headlining Ozzfest that summer. (The group also debuted a fully redesigned third generation of their famous masks.) Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses was released in May 2004. It peaked at number two on the Billboard 200, and the band toured steadily for the next year-and-a-half in support. They released a two-disc live album in November 2005, followed by a slew of side projects (Taylor and Root worked with Stone Sour, while Jordison sat in with Ministry and Korn) before releasing their fourth full-length album, All Hope Is Gone, in 2008. Slipknot made a number of festival appearances during the summer of the following year, and also embarked on their All Hope Is Gone world tour. On May 24, 2010, the body of bassist Paul Gray was discovered by a maintenance worker in an Urbandale, Iowa hotel room; he was 38 years old at the time of his death, which was later revealed to have been the result of an accidental drug overdose. Two years after suffering the tragedy of losing Gray, the band released their first compilation. Spanning 13 years of output, Antennas to Hell: The Best of Slipknot combined the best studio cuts from Corey Taylor and company, along with a selection of bonus material, including their full performance at 2009's Download Festival.\r\nIn 2013 Slipknot started work on what was to become their fifth studio album. During the recording process, the band and drummer Joey Jordison parted ways. The group recruited a drummer and bassist that were later confirmed to be, respectively, Jay Weinberg, formerly of Against Me, and Alessandro Venturella, formerly of Cry for Silence. Titled .5: The Gray Chapter in honor of their fallen bandmate, the album was released in October 2014. Marking a return to a more raw, brutal, dissonant sound reminiscent of their earlier work, it was promoted with the singles \"The Negative One\" and \"The Devil in I,\" which featured music videos directed by Shawn Crahan. 2017 saw the release of the Crahan-directed film Day of the Gusano, which documented Slipknot's first trip to Mexico and accompanying Mexico City Knotfest concert in late 2015.\r\nSlipknot returned in late 2018 with the standalone single \"All Out Life.\" Their critically acclaimed sixth studio album, the Greg Fidelman-produced We Are Not Your Kind, arrived in August 2019 and debuted at number one on both the U.S. Billboard 200 and the U.K. Albums Chart. Original drummer Joey Jordison died on July 26, 2021, at the age of 46. 2022 saw the release of The End, So Far, the band's final album for Roadrunner Records and the first Slipknot effort to feature new percussionist Michael Pfaff. Another global success, it peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 while topping the charts in the U.K., Australia, and Germany. The single \"Hive Mind\" was nominated for \"Best Metal Performance\" at the 66th Grammy Awards. Another lineup shift occurred in June 2023 with the sudden departure of longtime sampler/programmer Craig Jones, with his unknown masked replacement appearing on-stage the same day. That month, Slipknot issued an EP, Adderall, which included various versions of the title track. ~ Steve Huey",

    summary: "California band the Story So Far have roots in pop-punk, but they also bring in the harder edges of post-hardcore while tapping into the wistful romanticism of classic emo. The group evolved as they became one of the more popular acts of their kind, embracing a more indie-leaning sound and entering the Billboard charts with their 2018 breakout album, Proper Dose. A lengthy gap preceded its follow-up set, I Want to Disappear, which was released in 2024.\r\nHailing from Walnut Creek, California, the Story So Far formed in 2007. The founding lineup included vocalist Parker Cannon, guitarists Kevin Geyer and Kevin Ambrose, drummer Ryan Torf, and bassist Kelen Capener. Ambrose left the band in 2010 and was replaced by William Levy. The group signed with Pure Noise Records and released their debut full-length, Under Soil and Dirt, in 2011. Amid a heavy touring schedule, they also managed to release multiple EPs and split releases before offering up their second album, What You Don't See, in 2013. It spent a week on the Billboard 200 at number 46, a feat outdone by their eponymous 2015 LP, which reached number 23.\r\nBurnt out on touring, the Story So Far took a well-earned hiatus before returning to the studio in the spring of 2017 to start work on their fourth album, which was teased by the charity 7\" \"Out of It\" that September. Another single, \"Let It Go,\" appeared in July 2018, heralding the album's arrival two months later. Titled Proper Dose and inspired by the band's newfound collective love of the Beatles, it saw them pushing their songwriting in new directions with the addition of acoustic and electronic elements. Proper Dose became the group's highest-charting effort up until that point, debuting at the number 19 position on the Billboard Top 200. The band toured at length in support of the album and released new singles and videos from Proper Dose well into 2019.\r\nIn May 2022, Capener announced that he had left the band. Rather than immediately enlisting a new bassist, drummer Torf handled the bass parts for recording, and Nik Bruzzese came on as an auxiliary bass player for live shows. The Story So Far had only issued a live recording and some miscellaneous non-album material since Proper Dose, but they released the new studio track \"Big Blind\" in August 2023, ahead of their tour supporting blink-182. A second single, \"Letterman,\" appeared the following March as the band started to ramp up the promotional cycle for their fifth album. I Want to Disappear was released in June 2024 and reflected the members' emotional growth over the six years since their previous release. Muscular and focused, the album was recorded by producer/engineer Jon Markson at the Flemington, New Jersey studio Animal Farm. ~ Fred Thomas",

    summary: "Progressive instrumental quartet Strawberry Girls began in 2011 as a duo formed by guitarist Zachary Garren and drummer Benjamin Rosett. Garren had recently left post-hardcore act Dance Gavin Dance, and early jams with Rosett resulted in a demo that planted the seeds for the angular, quickly shifting sound that the band would refine as the years went on. Shortly after the duo began performing live, they were joined by bassist Ian Jennings and synth player Caleb Ellison and began recording and performing regularly. Their first few years were extremely active, with the band self-releasing several EPs as well as notable covers of hits by Kendrick Lamar and Carly Rae Jepsen. Debut album French Ghetto surfaced in 2013, and though the band was still primarily instrumental, many tracks featured different guest vocalists, a trend that would resurface on subsequent albums. By the release of 2015's American Graffiti, Ellison had left the band and the trio had signed to North Carolina-based indie label Tragic Hero Records. Tragic Hero would work closely with Strawberry Girls, re-releasing their first album as well as 2017's Italian Ghosts. ~ Fred Thomas",

    summary: "Formed in 1988 as a garage punk band, Sublime rose to fame in the mid-'90s on the back of the California punk explosion engendered by Green Day and the Offspring, though Sublime boosted their punk influences with heavy elements of reggae and ska. The band released only two albums during its first seven years, and finally found mainstream success with a self-titled release in 1996. It proved to be Sublime's last proper album, however, as lead singer Brad Nowell died in May 1996, just two months before the record's release.\r\nThe three Long Beach musicians who comprised Sublime -- vocalist/guitarist Nowell, bassist Eric Wilson, and drummer Bud Gaugh -- played their first gig on July 4, 1988, at a small Long Beach club (a show that sparked the infamous Peninsula Riot). The group began touring heavily while amassing an increasingly substantial following, especially among the surf/skate beach crowd. After four years of concentrating strictly on live shows, Sublime recorded their first album, 40oz. to Freedom, in 1992. The LP was released on Skunk Records -- a label formed by Nowell with Sublime manager Miguel -- and sold at local shows, but it really started to break when local radio station KROQ began playing the single \"Date Rape\" two years after its initial release.\r\nMostly due to that radio exposure, Sublime signed to MCA in time for 1994's Robbin' the Hood, which revealed an experimental ethic more in keeping with cut-and-paste dub than the well-tuned rage of the Cali punk revival. The album performed well at college radio and set the stage for the breakout success of their self-titled third album. On May 25, 1996, however, Nowell was found in a San Francisco hotel room, dead of a heroin overdose. The band collapsed, but the eponymous Sublime was still slated for a July release.\r\nOn the strength of the chart-topping alternative radio hit \"What I Got,\" the album was certified gold by the end of 1996. \"Santeria\" and \"Wrong Way\" also enjoyed heavy airplay, and Sublime eventually sold more than five-million copies, making it one of the most popular ska-punk albums in history. Such success spread to the band's earlier albums too, leading 40oz. to Freedom to double-platinum sales and Robbin' the Hood to gold certification. As Sublime's legend lived on, Wilson and Gaugh formed a new band called Long Beach Dub Allstars, although the group failed to capture the mainstream accolades that Sublime had briefly enjoyed. There were also a number of posthumous Sublime releases, among them 1997's Second Hand Smoke, 1998's Stand by Your Van and Acoustic: Bradley Nowell & Friends, Greatest Hits in 1999, and Gold in 2005.\r\nIn 2009, Wilson and Gaugh began touring with singer/songwriter Rome Ramirez under the moniker Sublime with Rome. In 2011, Sublime with Rome released their debut album, Yours Truly, on Fueled by Ramen. ~ John Bush",

    summary: "Juno Award-winning Canadian rock outfit Sum 41 balances energetic pop-punk and thrashing metal, a sound evolved over the decades as the once-playful crew grew into hardened scene elders. They hit the worldwide radar in 1996 after their hometown of Ajax, Ontario, proved unable to fully contain the foursome's early mixture of arena-sized riffing, hip-hop poses, and crass humor. Their breakthrough major-label debut, 2001's All Killer No Filler, featured the chart-topping MTV hit \"Fat Lip\" and its follow-up \"In Too Deep.\" From there, the band's mischievous pop-punk style was steadily hardened with darker, world-weary lyrics and a heavier, metal-inspired attack. By the time their double-platinum third effort, Chuck, landed in 2004, the band's metallic tendencies were at the fore. Lineup changes and health problems sidelined the band in the 2010s, but they made a successful comeback with the well-received 13 Voices (2016) and Order in Decline (2019). In 2023, Sum 41 announced they would officially disband after touring to support their 2024 double LP Heaven :x: Hell.\r\nIn addition to vocalist/guitarist Whibley, the band also originally included guitarist/vocalist Dave Baksh, bassist Cone McCaslin, and drummer Steve Jocz. Wooed by the boys' goofy antics and incendiary live show (and excited about the prospect of promoting their very own blink-182), Island put Sum 41 on the payroll in 1999. The Half Hour of Power EP followed, and Warped Tour dates put the word out. They returned in 2000 with the fun-filled full-length All Killer No Filler, and the singles \"In Too Deep\" and \"Fat Lip\" became staples of both modern rock radio and Total Request Live. An extensive tour followed, and Sum 41 enjoyed their success the way all near-teenage boys would, with plenty of towel-snapping, groupie-loving, and self-deprecating low-ball humor. In 2002, they returned to wax with Does This Look Infected? While the album was a bit harder-edged, it found the band as excited as ever to mix punk-pop business with sophomoric pleasure: The video for \"Hell Song\" featured the guys acting out a sort of rock-star, debauched cage match with the aid of a few celebrity action figures. Metallica, Jesus Christ, and the Osbournes all made appearances in the hilarious clip.\r\nIt was not all fun and games, however, as Sum 41 was involved with the charity group War Child Canada, and the helped make a 2004 documentary covering the effects of war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Five days into filming, fighting and gunfire suddenly erupted around them, and they barely escaped -- these events led to 2004's slightly more mature and serious effort, Chuck, named for the UN aid worker, Chuck Pelletier, who was instrumental in getting them to safety. The DVD Rocked: Sum 41 in Congo was released at the end of 2005, and the live album Go Chuck Yourself appeared the following March.\r\nGuitarist Dave Baksh left the band during the spring of 2006 due to creative differences, going on to form the metal-punk outfit Brown Brigade. Sum 41 continued as a trio, and their first album as such, Underclass Hero, appeared in July 2007. They eventually returned to being a quartet, replacing Baksh with guitarist Tom Thacker, and began to work on a new album. Screaming Bloody Murder appeared in March 2011. \"Blood in My Eyes,\" a single from the album, was nominated for a Grammy that year. However, due to a series of back injuries for Whibley (and other issues that would soon come to light), Sum 41 would not return with new material for half a decade, despite their critical success.\r\nDuring the break, Jocz left the band and was replaced by Street Drum Corps' Frank Zummo. Baksh also returned to the fold just in time for Sum 41's comeback in 2016. The group signed with Hopeless Records and embarked on an international tour that included stops in China and a stint on that summer's Warped Tour. Their sixth LP, 13 Voices, featured the lead single \"Fake My Own Death\" and became their third highest-charting release in their native Canada, peaking just outside the Top 20 in the U.S. During promotion for the album, Whibley revealed that he had been in an alcohol-related induced coma during the band's hiatus in 2014. While recovery included learning to walk and play guitar again, Whibley contributed a large part of his healing to the writing process of 13 Voices. To coincide with the album's release, the band embarked on an international tour dubbed \"Don't Call It a Sum-Back.\"\r\nAfter setting out on another trek to celebrate the 15th anniversary of their breakthrough, they returned to the studio. Their seventh set, Order in Decline, arrived in the summer of 2019. Intensely political and pulling no punches with their message, the album included the tracks \"Out for Blood,\" \"45 (A Matter of Time),\" and \"The New Sensation,\" borrowing from Linkin Park, Bad Religion, and even Muse on a series of rallying cries aimed at waking up a society on the brink of moral collapse. In 2022, the band announced that their next album, the sprawling double LP Heaven :x: Hell, would be evenly split between nostalgic pop-punk and metal. It would also be their last album, as Sum 41 would officially cease operations following an international tour supporting the effort. \"Landmines,\" the first single from the release, appeared in 2023; following \"Rise Up\" and \"Waiting on a Twist of Fate,\" the album landed in March 2024. ~ Johnny Loftus & Neil Z.

    summary: "Striking a balance between '80s underground thrash metal and metallic early-'90s alternative rock, Armenian-American quartet System of a Down effectively pushed their socially conscious, politically charged messages into the mosh pits during the turn of the century's nu-metal wave. Their dark and wild style led them from a cult following to a full-blown movement with breakout hit Toxicity, which debuted at number one in 2001 and planted them at the top of the charts through the early 2000s with a pair of related albums, Mezmerize and Hypnotize. Soon afterward, the band took an extended hiatus, branching off into various solo projects while maintaining a cultural presence with sporadic concerts and continued efforts to spread awareness of the Armenian genocide. They would not return until 2020 when they released their first fresh material in 15 years, \"Protect the Land\" b/w \"Genocidal Humanoidz,\" the proceeds of which went to the humanitarian needs of families displaced by the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war.\r\nVocalist Serj Tankian, guitarist Daron Malakian, bassist Shavo Odadjian, and drummer John Dolmayan formed System of a Down in Southern California in the mid-'90s. They quickly earned a strong following in Los Angeles, largely based on strong word of mouth. A three-song demo began circulating through metal collectors, and their fan base soon spread throughout not only America, but Europe and New Zealand.\r\nBy the end of 1997 the group had signed to American, distributed by Columbia Records. American/Columbia released the group's eponymous debut in the summer of 1998, securing the band opening spots on the Slayer and Ozzfest tours. Carried by alternative radio hits \"Sugar\" and \"Spiders,\" System eventually went platinum, leading to the September 2001 release of the even more ambitious Toxicity. Their first chart-topper, System's second effort was another heavy music triumph, shaming the majority of their nu-metal competition and running away with multi-platinum honors around the world. Featuring the singles \"Chop Suey!\" and \"Aerials,\" the album would become a landmark release for the period and their defining statement.\r\nWithout losing momentum, Malakian started the eatURmusic imprint, and Tankian founded a label called Serjical Strike; Tankian also collaborated with Armenian avant-garde folk musician Arto Tuncboyaciyan in a project called Serart. In November 2002 System issued the bare-bones but no less powerful odds-n-ends set Steal This Album!, culled from the Toxicity sessions.\r\nBy 2004, System of a Down was back in the studio with Rick Rubin. The bold result of those sessions was a single epic album released in two parts. Mezmerize/Hypnotize kept System's furious creativity alive, incorporating the wild vocal melodies, lyrical passion, and rabid structural shifts that had become their trademark. Mezmerize (Pt. 1) appeared in May 2005, while Hypnotize (Pt. 2) appeared later in the year, and both hit the top of the album charts.\r\nThe following year, the group went on hiatus, with Malakian forming Scars on Broadway; Dolmayan opening an online comic book store and forming the group Indicator (he also briefly played with Scars on Broadway); Odadjian working with RZA, AcHoZeN, and George Clinton, and Tankian embarking on a solo career. While they toured off-and-on throughout the 2010s, the foursome remained split, working on their personal musical projects while continuing to raise awareness for Armenian causes. One of those -- the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war -- prompted System to reunite for the charity single \"Protect the Land\" b/w \"Genocidal Humanoidz,\" which raised over half-a-million dollars for families displaced by the fighting. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine & Neil Z.

    summary: "Tool established themselves as one of America's most enduring and unpredictable acts with an ever-evolving brand of muscular but mind-altering sonics, a wry sense of humor, and a mystical aesthetic that attracted a cult-like following of devoted fans with just a handful of albums spread across decades. Their greatest breakthrough was to meld dark underground metal with the ambition of art rock, crafting multi-sectioned, layered songs as if they were classical composers. While embracing the artsy, they also paid musical homage to the relentlessly bleak visions of grindcore, death metal, and thrash. Even with their post-punk influences, they executed their music with the sound and feel of prog rock, alternating between long, detailed instrumental interludes and lyrical rants in their songs. Debuting in the early '90s with Undertow, they were initially lumped in with the nu-metal contemporaries of the time, which made them a hit on rock radio with their sophomore effort, 1996's Ænima. However, they soon broke away from those associations, evolving beyond the confines of traditional song structures and song lengths, crafting epics that often clocked in past the ten-minute mark on LP head-trips Lateralus (2001) and 10,000 Days (2006). After a lengthy 13-year hiatus, they returned to the fold in 2019 with their fifth opus, the chart-topping, Grammy-nominated Fear Inoculum. In 2022, they celebrated their 30th anniversary with \"Opiate²,\" a re-recorded version of their debut single.\r\nFormed in Los Angeles by percussionist Danny Carey, guitarist Adam Jones, vocalist Maynard James Keenan, and original bassist Paul D'Amour, Tool had a knack for conveying the strangled, oppressive angst that the alternative nation of the early '90s claimed as its own, which helped them slip into the scene during the post-Nirvana era. Buffered by a prime slot on the third Lollapalooza tour in 1993, their debut full-length album, Undertow (Zoo Entertainment), rocketed to platinum status. Fervor for the band even resurrected their first effort, 1992's Opiate EP, on the Billboard charts. While they were in the studio recording a follow-up, D'Amour amicably parted ways with Tool and his spot was filled by Justin Chancellor. By the time the fresh quartet delivered their sophomore album, Ænima, in late 1996, the alternative rock mainstream was ready. The album shot to number two on the Billboard charts and was certified multi-platinum in less than a decade. Singles \"Stinkfist,\" \"Forty Six & 2,\" and the Grammy-winning title track were all Top Ten hits on the U.S. Rock chart, boosted by the twisted and often disturbing music videos created by Jones. After a co-headlining slot with Korn on Lollapalooza '97, Tool remained on the road, supporting Ænima into the next year.\r\nAs nu-metal established its mainstream dominance at the close of the decade, Tool returned to the shadows. During their hiatus, Keenan formed a side project with former Tool guitar tech Billy Howerdel. A Perfect Circle debuted in 2000, and their album Mer de Noms was a surprise hit. Their ensuing tour was a sold-out success as well, which only served to fuel Tool breakup rumors. To quell the speculation, they issued the stopgap B-sides/DVD set Salival late the same year. Meanwhile, in the studio, the band continued to journey down a new path that further distanced them from the mainstream. Delving deeper into their own mythos, songs grew longer, lyrics more inscrutable, and artwork increasingly psychedelic. Though they retained their pummeling, metal-oriented base, the quartet smashed the formula by further experimenting with complex time signatures, expansive atmospherics, and a classical approach to song compositions. The first taste of 21st century Tool arrived in January 2001 with the Grammy-winning single, \"Schism,\" which was also their first song to chart on the Hot 100. Lateralus (Volcano) arrived that May, topping the Billboard 200. Subsequent singles \"Parabola\" and \"Lateralus\" were favorites on the U.S. Rock charts, and the album soon went multi-platinum.\r\nAfter another several-year sabbatical -- during which time Keenan bounced back to A Perfect Circle -- the group returned with another chart-topper, 2006's 10,000 Days. Their most esoteric statement yet, the album spawned the singles \"Vicarious,\" \"Jambi,\" and U.S. Mainstream Rock number one \"The Pot.\" Although it was also the band's lowest-selling effort to date, the record still managed to win the group their third Grammy Award for Best Recording Package. At the conclusion of touring, Tool began another extended hiatus. Although the band re-emerged for a brief summer tour in 2009, it would be another ten years before fans could hear new music. During this period, Keenan debuted his de facto solo project, Puscifer, and returned for a third album with A Perfect Circle. Behind the scenes, the band was also bogged down by a lawsuit that wouldn't be resolved until 2015. The next year, shaking off the cobwebs, Tool returned to the road for another quick jaunt in the U.S., kicking off another cycle of speculation from fans starved for new material.\r\nAfter an interminable 13-year gap between albums, Tool returned in 2019 with their epic fifth album, Fear Inoculum. Their third straight chart-topper, the set also featured their second Hot 100 placement to date, the ten-minute title track, which became the longest song to ever appear on that chart. Meanwhile, for the first time, Tool made their entire discography available for streaming; this propelled all of their past albums back to the charts, breaking records in the process. They embarked on a sold-out arena tour of the U.S. alongside Killing Joke and capped their successful comeback with a pair of Grammy nominations for \"7empest\" and \"Fear Inoculum.\" The former track scored them a Grammy in 2020 for Best Metal Performance. In March 2022, they released \"Opiate²,\" a re-recorded version of their 1991 single \"Opiate,\" issued to mark the 30th anniversary of their debut EP. ~ Neil Z. Yeung & Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    summary: "Veil of Maya is a Chicago-based metalcore unit that incorporates elements of djent and deathcore into their punishing sonic assault. Surfacing in 2004, the band adhered to a strict deathcore template on early efforts like 2010's Id. The introduction of clean vocals on 2015's Billboard-charting Matriarch coincided with a pivot into metalcore territory, while 2017's False Idol and 2023's [m}other added the distinctive, palm-muted throb of djent to the mix.\r\nFormed in 2004 by ex-Insurrection members Marc Okubo (guitar), Sam Applebaum (drums), and Kris Higler (bass), Veil of Maya merged into a quintet with the arrival of guitarist Bryan Ruppell and vocalist Adam Clemans. Their self-produced debut album, All Things Set Aside, was released in 2006, and the band spent the lion's share of the next two years promoting it through the age-old ritual of constant regional and national touring. Clemens and Ruppell left the group ahead of album number two, The Common Man's Collapse. Released in 2008 on Sumerian Records, the LP marked the studio debut of new vocalist Brandon Butler. Veil of Maya promoted the record with high-profile shows alongside contemporaries Arsis, A Life Once Lost, and labelmates Born of Osiris. Higler left the fold in 2009, making way for former Born of Osiris bassist Matthew Pantelis, who debuted on 2010's Id. Produced by the Faceless' Michael Keene, the album reached number 107 on the Billboard 200. 2012's savage and condensed Eclipse, which clocked in at just over 28 minutes, saw Dan Hauser take over bass duties from Matthew Pantelis.\r\nVocalist Brandon Butler left the band in 2014, citing creative differences. The arrival of Arms of Empire singer Lukas Magyar signaled a new direction for Veil of Maya. Utilizing clean singing for the first time, 2015's metalcore-forward Matriarch proved the band's most commercially successful effort yet, soaring to number two on the Billboard hard rock chart. Now operating as a quartet (Okubo, Applebaum, Hauser, and Magyar), the band issued a pair of vicious, djent-fueled singles, \"Overthrow\" and \"Doublespeak,\" ahead of the release of 2017's False Idol. Like its predecessor, the album reached the upper echelons of Billboard's rock charts. A trio of standalone singles (\"Outrun,\" \"Viscera,\" and \"Outsider\") appeared in 2020 and 2021, with the crushing, prog-metalcore-leaning \"Synthwave Vegan\" arriving the following year. The like-minded \"Godhead\" and \"Red Fur\" were unveiled in early 2023, with all three cuts appearing on the group's sixth long-player, [m]other, later that May. ~ James Christopher Monger",

    summary: "Best known for their alternative radio classic \"Mexican Radio,\" Wall of Voodoo formed in Los Angeles in 1977, originally as a soundtrack company. Led by singer/songwriter Stan Ridgway and rounded out by guitarist Marc Moreland, bassist/keyboardist Bruce Moreland, keyboardist Chas Gray, and drummer Joe Nanini, the group issued its self-titled debut EP in 1980. With the additions of bassist Bruce Moreland and his brother Marc on guitar (replacing Noland), the band's sound crystallized on 1981's full-length Dark Continent, which couched Ridgway's highly stylized and cinematic narratives -- heavily influenced by Westerns and film noir, and sung in the vocalist's distinctively droll, narcoleptic manner -- in atonal, electronically based settings.\r\nIn 1982, following the exit of Bruce Moreland, Wall of Voodoo released Call of the West, which featured \"Mexican Radio,\" their biggest hit. After an appearance at the 1983 US Festival, Ridgway left the group for a solo career. The remaining members enlisted singer Andy Prieboy, and resurfaced in 1985 with the LP Seven Days in Sammystown. Happy Planet followed two years later, while 1988's live effort The Ugly Americans in Australia* (the asterisk denoting that a few tracks were recorded in Bullhead City, Arizona) effectively closed out the Wall of Voodoo story. ~ Jason Ankeny",
